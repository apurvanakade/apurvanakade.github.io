I'm a postdoc at the [[http://www.math.uwo.ca/][University of Western
Ontario]] working with [[https://jdc.math.uwo.ca/][Dan Christensen]] and
[[http://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/][Chris Kapulkin]].

I'm currently teaching Algebraic Topology.

* DRP
Directed Reading Program is a program for undergrads and grad students/postdocs.
Undergrads are paired with a mentor whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester.
It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting.
I co-organize the [[https://www.math.uwo.ca/undergraduate/directed_reading_program.html][DRP at UWO]] and in the past have co-organized the [[https://math.jhu.edu/drp.html][DRP at JHU]].
