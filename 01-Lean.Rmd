# Me, Math, Machine

I have recently gotten interesting in teaching math to computers using [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/about/). 
This is different from doing computations as here we are trying to teach math to computers the same way we understand it.

[Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/live/latest/) is an open-source software that understands mathematics and can check correctness of proofs. 
It was developed my computer scientists at Microsoft Research but has since been overtaken my mathematicians who now form the [leanprover-community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) and maintain its rapidly growing [math library](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/).

My primary interest in Lean is as a potential tool for teaching math proofs. 
My secondary interest lies in combining machine learning and theorem proving. 
<!-- [Some progress](https://github.com/metamath/set.mm/wiki/Automated-proving) is already being made on this front for a more basic theorem prover called [Metamath](http://us.metamath.org/).  -->
These are very long term goals as the field of theorem proving, although rapidly growing, is still very nascent.
Currently, I try to teach Lean to students and am working on contributing to Lean's math library.

## Learning to Lean

Lean is accessible to anyone who understands basic theorem proving in math.
You can find several learning resources [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html).
I personally learned Lean by playing the [Natural numbers game](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/), reading [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/introduction.html), and banging my head against the wall while solving some problems on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean). However, online resources are not enough for learning the language.
There is a very helpful and supportive Lean community on [zulipchat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) where you can ask questions and get help to your heart's content.

The best way to learn is by teaching. 
And so, I taught a course [Lean at MC2020](courses/lean_at_MC2020/index.html) at Mathcamp 2020 where we taught Lean the proof of irrationality of \( \sqrt{2} \).
