I have a certification from the Teaching Academy at JHU. I was a mentor for Canada/USA Mathcamp from 2017-2019 and an academic coordinator for the summer of 2018. I completed my PhD from JHU in 2019 with a thesis titled An application of the h-principle to Manifold Calculus. I have an MSc in Mathematics from Chennai Mathematical Institute and a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. "],["math-notes.html", "Math Notes UWO Canada/USA Mathcamp JHU Expository notes", " Math Notes I love to design and teach new, and sometimes old, courses. Below are notes and problem sets from several of my courses. Most notes are accessible to undergraduate and advanced high-school students. UWO Algebraic Topology Problem Sets. In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology aimed at graduate students and upper-level undergrads. The main textbook for the course was Hatcher but I rarely used the book at all. The course covers the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology. Discrete Math \\[ \\begin{align} \\left|\\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\\right|=\\sum _{i=1}^{n}|A_{i}|-\\sum _{1\\leqslant i&lt;j\\leqslant n}|A_{i}\\cap A_{j}|+\\sum _{1\\leqslant i&lt;j&lt;k\\leqslant n}|A_{i}\\cap A_{j}\\cap A_{k}|-\\cdots +(-1)^{n-1}\\left|A_{1}\\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{n}\\right| \\end{align} \\] Video lectures In Fall 2020, I taught a semester-long at UWO on Discrete Math aimed at second-year undergrads majoring in computer science. The course was fully asynchronous and I had to come up with several innovations to make it work. I curated a textbook on zyBooks and created several videos on YouTube to accompany the text. I used Piazza as a platform for discussions. With a lot of help from my department, we also created hundreds of questions on WeBWork which were then used the exams. This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding course I’ve ever taught. Canada/USA Mathcamp Lean at MC2020 Notes.   Source Code.

Expository notes Following are some of my personal math notes. The notes have not been proofread and might contain errors. What is a Spectrum? h-principles MSRI Summer School Connections on Principal Bundles and Classical Electromagnetism Vector Fields on Spheres Steifel Whitney Numbers Homotopy of MO Representation Theory of Symmetric Group Geometry of Dirac Operators FIOs and Lagrangian Submanifolds Symplectic Geometry Course Notes Finite Gauge Groups TQFTs Classical Lie Groups Mosher and Tangora Notes "],["research.html", "Research", " Research My research is in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. My broad interests are in understanding how homotopy theoretic tools can be used to solve problems from other areas of math. String structures, 2-group bundles, and a categorification of the Freed-Quinn line bundle ArXiv preprint I got involved in this project thanks to the MRC Workshop. 2-groups are higher categorical variants of groups. In this project, we provide a 2-categorical interpretation of some of naturally occurring objects (Drinfield double of a group) in mathematical physics and extend them using ideas from Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology. This is a joint work with Daniel Berwick-Evans, Emily Cliff, Laura Murray, and Emma Phillips. PhD thesis: An application of the \\(h\\)-principle to Manifold Calculus Paper in Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures ArXiv preprint Original Thesis Notes from a talk Thesis defense presentation In my PhD thesis, I applied homotopy theoretic techniques to study problems for differential geometry. I showed that the technique of manifold calculus cannot be used to analyze the space of isosymplectic embeddings of symplectic manifolds. This thesis also provides a broad class of examples of non-analytic embedding functors (in the sense of manifold calculus). Protein folding using Markov chains Paper in Information Processing Letters, IPL4801 During my undergrad, I briefly worked on a project analyzing a Markov chain model of protein folding. We showed that the mixing time of the Metropolis algorithm is not a decreasing function of the value of gap between the lowest and the second lowest energies. This is joint work with Somenath Biswas.

It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting. I’ve helped start and organize the DRP at UWO and in the past have co-organized the DRP at JHU. If you are interested in participating in the DRP or would like to run one at your university, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Following is the list of projects I’ve mentored in the past. Clare Bedford, Surreal Numbers. (UWO, Winter 2021) Jacob Fabe, Fundamental Group from Topology by Munkres. (UWO, Fall 2020) Tim Yau, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (UWO, Fall 2019) Hannah Wool, Topology by Munkres. (JHU, Spring 2019) Sydney Timmerman, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Marián Fecko. (JHU, Fall 2018) Eric Cochran, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (JHU, Spring 2018) Chris Chia, The Knot Book by Adams Collins. (JHU, Fall 2017) Canada/USA Mathcamp Canada/USA is an intensive 5-week-long summer program cult for mathematically talented high school students. I was fortunate to be able to participate in this amazing place for four summers. Here, I had the unique opportunity to constantly experiment with my teaching and I learned a lot from my fellow educators and students. If you are a high-school student/graduate student interested in Canada/USA Mathcamp, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for information. Below are notes from some of the classes I designed and taught at Mathcamp. Teaching Academy, JHU I took a semester long course at the Teaching Academy at JHU while I was a graduate student. The Teaching Academy offers Ph.D. students and Post-doctoral Fellows from all divisions across Johns Hopkins University, college teacher training and academic career preparation opportunities through courses, workshops, teaching practicums, teaching-as-research fellowships, and individual consultation. This program exposed me to the concept of teaching as an intellectual endeavor and really got me interested in my current career as a math educator. Project NExT, MAA Mathematical American Association’s Project NExT (New Experiences in Teaching) is a professional development program for new or recent Ph.D.s in the mathematical sciences. It addresses all aspects of an academic career: improving the teaching and learning of mathematics, engaging in research and scholarship, finding exciting and interesting service opportunities, and participating in professional activities. For me the greatest value of this program is the opportunity it provides to connect to with and learn from other math educators from all over the country.
