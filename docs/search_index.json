"],["recommendation-letters.html", "Recommendation Letters How to ask for a rec letter", " Recommendation Letters This section contains advice for people asking for a letter of recommendation from me. It is in your interest to make your letter writer’s job as easy as possible. I understand that asking for a recommendation letter can be unnerving and daunting. As a student, you might even be unsure as to whether you can ask me for a letter. Please understand that letter-writing is one of my most important duties. If you were in any of my classes and received a good grade, you are entitled to get rec letters from me. You do not have to have “interacted” with me or “participated” in the lecture in any way.1 How to ask for a rec letter Timeline: Please give me as much notice as possible so I can write as detailed a letter as I would like. At least a month is reasonable. Any shorter notice, and you should expect a brief, superficial letter. Email: Send a formal email request. Try to include all the information in a single email. If you do not have everything available, just share a folder with the information you have and update it regularly. Provide as much information as you think might be relevant. More information is always preferred to less. Here are some common documents to share (drafts are acceptable): A document/email will all the deadlines CV Unofficial transcripts Statement of Purpose Program information Upload instructions Reminders: It’s ok to send reminders. In fact, I encourage you to send me a reminder email a week before a deadline. Verbal reminders are useless. Send your reminder by email. Having said that, if I do not know you personally or if you do not provide me enough time/information, my rec letter would be extremely short, just describing your scores in the course.↩︎ "],["math-notes.html", "Math Notes Northwestern UWO Canada/USA JHU Expository notes", " Math Notes I love to design and teach new, and sometimes old, courses. Below are notes and problem sets from several of my courses. Most notes are accessible to undergraduate and advanced high-school students.

The course covers mainly linear programming and duality theory. The above course notes are accessible to students who have done linear algebra and some basic multivariable calculus (gradients). UWO Algebraic topology Problem Sets. In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology aimed at graduate students and upper-level undergrads. The main textbook for the course was Hatcher but I rarely used the book at all. The course covers the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology. Discrete math \\[ \\begin{align} \\left|\\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\\right|=\\sum _{i=1}^{n}|A_{i}|-\\sum _{1\\leqslant i&lt;j\\leqslant n}|A_{i}\\cap A_{j}|+\\sum _{1\\leqslant i&lt;j&lt;k\\leqslant n}|A_{i}\\cap A_{j}\\cap A_{k}|-\\cdots +(-1)^{n-1}\\left|A_{1}\\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{n}\\right| \\end{align} \\] Video lectures In Fall 2020, I taught a semester-long at UWO on Discrete Math aimed at second-year undergrads majoring in computer science. The course was fully asynchronous and I had to come up with several innovations to make it work. I curated a textbook on zyBooks and created several videos on YouTube to accompany the text. I used Piazza as a platform for discussions. With a lot of help from my department, we also created hundreds of questions on WeBWork which were then used the exams. This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding course I’ve ever taught. Canada/USA Lean at MC2020 Notes.   Source Code. This is a completely interactive class on the Lean theorem prover from Mathcamp 2020 - you learn by solving exercises online. The prerequisites for this class are basic proof techniques. Crash course on linear algebra Notes. This is a week-long proof-based introduction to Linear Algebra class from Mathcamp 2018. The prerequisites are basic proof techniques. The class is designed in an IBL-format - you’re expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject. Galois correspondence of covering spaces Notes. This week-long class from Mathcamp 2019 covers (pun intended) the covering space theory for graphs and surfaces and is meant to be an introduction to algebraic topology and its connection to group theory. The prerequisites are group theory and basic minimal exposure to topology/analysis. From high school arithmetic to group cohomology \\[ \\begin{align} 0 \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/10 \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/100 \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/10 \\longrightarrow 0 \\end{align} \\] Notes. This is a week-long class from Mathcamp 2019 based on a fun paper by Dan Isaken titled A cohomological viewpoint of elementary school arithmetic. It introduces the notions of group extensions and exact sequences as means to interpret addition of multi-digit numbers. It is designed in an IBL-format - you’re expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject. The prerequisites are group theory. Cohomology via sheaves Notes. This is a week-long class from Mathcamp 2018 about Čech cohomology on graphs and cohomology computations for simple spaces. The class is designed in an IBL-format - you’re expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject. The prerequisites are linear algebra (over finite fields). How curved is a potato? Notes. This is a week-long class from Mathcamp 2018 about principal, Gaussian, and mean curvature of potatoes embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). The prerequisites are linear algebra, in particular, the notions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and multi-variable calculus. Would I ever lie group to you? Notes. I taught this week-long class at Mathcamp 2018. This is a class about matrix groups and how they arise as symmetries of spaces. The prerequisites are linear algebra and group theory, in particular, group actions. Riemann surfaces Problem Sets. I taught this week-long class at Mathcamp 2019. In this class, we construct Riemann surfaces as “graphs” of holomorphic functions. Towards the end we prove Fermat’s last theorem for function fields. The prerequisites are complex analysis. The following are a few other classes I taught at Mathcamp. The notes are not very polished. How Riemann finally understood logarithms How to glue donuts All things manifoldy Euler Characteristic Symmetries of Spaces JHU Honors single variable calculus Notes v2017.   Notes v2018. For two semesters, Fall 2017 &amp; 2018, I taught an accelerated honors single variable calculus course at JHU. The course covers two semesters worth of calculus (integration and differentiation) in one semester. The course is designed in an IBL-format - you’re expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject. The prerequisites are pre-calculus and basic theorem proving. Symmetries &amp; polynomials \\[ \\begin{align} {\\sqrt[{3}]{-{\\frac {q}{2}}+{\\sqrt {{\\frac {q^{2}}{4}}+{\\frac {p^{3}}{27}}}}}}+{\\sqrt[{3}]{-{\\frac {q}{2}}-{\\sqrt {{\\frac {q^{2}}{4}}+{\\frac {p^{3}}{27}}}}}}.\\end{align} \\] Notes. This 2-week class from Intersession 2018 at JHU non-math majors to group theory and its connections to roots of polynomials, in particular, the unsolvability of the quintic. The class is designed in an IBL-format - you’re expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject. The prerequisites are basic proof techniques. Hitchhiker’s guide to algebraic topology Course Website. This 2-week class from the Intersession 2017 at JHU introduces non-math majors to algebraic topology and its applications. There are no prerequisites.
