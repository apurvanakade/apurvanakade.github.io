"],["for-students.html", "For Students Recommendation Letters Math Notes", " For Students Recommendation Letters This section contains advice for people asking for a letter of recommendation from me. I understand that asking for a recommendation letter can be unnerving and daunting. As a student, you might even be unsure as to whether you can ask me for a letter. Please understand that letter-writing is one of my most important duties. If you were in any of my classes and received a decent grade, you are entitled to get rec letters from me. You do not have to have interacted with me or participated in the lecture in any way. Having said that, if I do not know you personally or if you do not provide me enough time/information, my rec letter would be extremely short, just describing your scores in the course. How to ask for a rec letter It is in your interest to make your letter writers job as easy as possible. Timeline: Please give me as much notice as possible so I can write as detailed a letter as I would like. At least a month is reasonable. Any shorter notice, and you should expect a brief, superficial letter. Email: Send a formal email request. Ill neglect any other kind of messaging (including oral requests). Include all the information in a single email (see below). Minimize the number of email interactions necessary. Documents: Create a shared folder for your documents and include the sharing link in the email. This way, Ill always have an updated copy of your statements. Provide as much information as you think might be relevant. More information is always preferred to less. Here are some common documents to share (drafts are acceptable): A document/email will all the deadlines CV Unofficial transcripts Statement of Purpose Cover letter(s) Program information Upload instructions Reminders: Its ok to send reminders. In fact, I encourage you to send me a reminder email a week before a deadline. Verbal reminders are useless. Send your reminder by email. Math Notes I love to design and teach new, and sometimes old, courses. Below are notes and problem sets from several of my courses. Most notes are accessible to undergraduate and advanced high-school students. UWO Algebraic Topology Problem Sets. In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology aimed at graduate students and upper-level undergrads. The main textbook for the course was Hatcher but I rarely used the book at all. The course covers the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology. Discrete Math \\[ \\begin{align} \\left|\\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\\right|=\\sum _{i=1}^{n}|A_{i}|-\\sum _{1\\leqslant i&lt;j\\leqslant n}|A_{i}\\cap A_{j}|+\\sum _{1\\leqslant i&lt;j&lt;k\\leqslant n}|A_{i}\\cap A_{j}\\cap A_{k}|-\\cdots +(-1)^{n-1}\\left|A_{1}\\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{n}\\right| \\end{align} \\] Video lectures In Fall 2020, I taught a semester-long at UWO on Discrete Math aimed at second-year undergrads majoring in computer science. The course was fully asynchronous and I had to come up with several innovations to make it work. I curated a textbook on zyBooks and created several videos on YouTube to accompany the text. I used Piazza as a platform for discussions. With a lot of help from my department, we also created hundreds of questions on WeBWork which were then used the exams. This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding course Ive ever taught. Canada/USA Lean at MC2020 Notes.   Source Code.

Im a member of the Project NExT Brown20 cohort. I have a certification from the Teaching Academy at JHU. I was a mentor for Canada/USA Mathcamp from 2017-2019 and an academic coordinator for the summer of 2018. I completed my PhD from JHU in 2019 with a thesis titled An application of the h-principle to Manifold Calculus. I have an MSc in Mathematics from Chennai Mathematical Institute and a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Professional Development Following are some programs that have helped me greatly on my journey of becoming a math educator: DRP The Directed Reading Program is a program in which undergrads are paired with a graduate student/postdoc whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester. It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting. Ive helped start and organize the DRP at UWO and in the past have co-organized the DRP at JHU. If you are interested in participating in the DRP or would like to run one at your university, please dont hesitate to reach out to me. Following is the list of projects Ive mentored in the past. Clare Bedford, Surreal Numbers. (UWO, Winter 2021) Jacob Fabe, Fundamental Group from Topology by Munkres. (UWO, Fall 2020) Tim Yau, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (UWO, Fall 2019) Hannah Wool, Topology by Munkres. (JHU, Spring 2019) Sydney Timmerman, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Marián Fecko. (JHU, Fall 2018) Eric Cochran, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (JHU, Spring 2018) Chris Chia, The Knot Book by Adams Collins. (JHU, Fall 2017) Canada/USA Mathcamp Canada/USA is an intensive 5-week-long summer program cult for mathematically talented high school students. I was fortunate to be able to participate in this amazing place for four summers. Here, I had the unique opportunity to constantly experiment with my teaching and I learned a lot from my fellow educators and students. If you are a high-school student/graduate student interested in Canada/USA Mathcamp, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for information. Below are notes from some of the classes I designed and taught at Mathcamp. Teaching Academy, JHU I took a semester long course at the Teaching Academy at JHU while I was a graduate student. The Teaching Academy offers Ph.D. students and Post-doctoral Fellows from all divisions across Johns Hopkins University, college teacher training and academic career preparation opportunities through courses, workshops, teaching practicums, teaching-as-research fellowships, and individual consultation. This program exposed me to the concept of teaching as an intellectual endeavor and really got me interested in my current career as a math educator. Project NExT, MAA Mathematical American Associations Project NExT (New Experiences in Teaching) is a professional development program for new or recent Ph.D.s in the mathematical sciences. It addresses all aspects of an academic career: improving the teaching and learning of mathematics, engaging in research and scholarship, finding exciting and interesting service opportunities, and participating in professional activities. For me the greatest value of this program is the opportunity it provides to connect to with and learn from other math educators from all over the country. Research My research is in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. My broad interests are in understanding how homotopy theoretic tools can be used to solve problems from other areas of math. String structures, 2-group bundles, and a categorification of the Freed-Quinn line bundle ArXiv preprint I got involved in this project thanks to the MRC Workshop. 2-groups are higher categorical variants of groups. In this project, we provide a 2-categorical interpretation of some of naturally occurring objects (Drinfield double of a group) in mathematical physics and extend them using ideas from Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology. This is a joint work with Daniel Berwick-Evans, Emily Cliff, Laura Murray, and Emma Phillips. PhD thesis: An application of the \\(h\\)-principle to Manifold Calculus Paper in Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures ArXiv preprint Original Thesis Notes from a talk Thesis defense presentation In my PhD thesis, I applied homotopy theoretic techniques to study problems for differential geometry. I showed that the technique of manifold calculus cannot be used to analyze the space of isosymplectic embeddings of symplectic manifolds. This thesis also provides a broad class of examples of non-analytic embedding functors (in the sense of manifold calculus). Protein folding using Markov chains Paper in Information Processing Letters, IPL4801 During my undergrad, I briefly worked on a project analyzing a Markov chain model of protein folding. We showed that the mixing time of the Metropolis algorithm is not a decreasing function of the value of gap between the lowest and the second lowest energies. This is joint work with Somenath Biswas.
