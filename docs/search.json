The course was fully asynchronous and I had to come up with several innovations to make it work. I curated a textbook on zyBooks and created several videos on YouTube to accompany the text. I used Piazza as a platform for discussions. With a lot of help from my department, we also created hundreds of questions on WeBWork which were then used the exams. This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding course I’ve ever taught."

Now that I’m entering a new phase of my life at JHU, here I am once again. I plan to write about the topics that currently occupy my thoughts: math, teaching learning, Lean, programming, philosophy of mind, books, movies, and more…\nFor me, writing serves as a way to clarify my thoughts while staying honest and consistent. As the wise Feynman once said “The first principle is not to fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.” Expressing your thoughts and putting them out in the world (for nobody to read) is the first step towards that.\nThe title of this post is a meditation prompt by Sam Harris. I’m serious about practicing meditation and mindfulness, but regrettably, not very good at it. Whenever I catch myself doing something I would rather not (like procrastinating writing), I just remind myself to Begin Again.\nSo here’s to not fooling yourself and to new beginnings."
