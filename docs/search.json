The main textbook for the course was Hatcher but I rarely used the book at all. The course covers the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology.\n\n\nDiscrete math\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left|\\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\\right|=\\sum _{i=1}^{n}|A_{i}|-\\sum _{1\\leqslant i&lt;j\\leqslant n}|A_{i}\\cap A_{j}|+\\sum _{1\\leqslant i&lt;j&lt;k\\leqslant n}|A_{i}\\cap A_{j}\\cap A_{k}|-\\cdots +(-1)^{n-1}\\left|A_{1}\\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{n}\\right|\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nVideo lectures\nIn Fall 2020, I taught a semester-long at UWO on Discrete Math aimed at second-year undergrads majoring in computer science. The course was fully asynchronous and I had to come up with several innovations to make it work. I curated a textbook on zyBooks and created several videos on YouTube to accompany the text. I used Piazza as a platform for discussions. With a lot of help from my department, we also created hundreds of questions on WeBWork which were then used the exams. This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding course I’ve ever taught."

The prerequisites for this class are basic proof techniques.\n\n\nCrash course on linear algebra\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes.\nThis is a week-long proof-based introduction to Linear Algebra class from Mathcamp 2018. The prerequisites are basic proof techniques. The class is designed in an IBL-format - you’re expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject.\n\n\nGalois correspondence of covering spaces\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes.\nThis week-long class from Mathcamp 2019 covers (pun intended) the covering space theory for graphs and surfaces and is meant to be an introduction to algebraic topology and its connection to group theory. The prerequisites are group theory and basic minimal exposure to topology/analysis.\n\n\nFrom high school arithmetic to group cohomology\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n  0 \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/10 \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/100 \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/10 \\longrightarrow 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNotes.\nThis is a week-long class from Mathcamp 2019 based on a fun paper by Dan Isaken titled A cohomological viewpoint of elementary school arithmetic. It introduces the notions of group extensions and exact sequences as means to interpret addition of multi-digit numbers. It is designed in an IBL-format - you’re expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject. The prerequisites are group theory.\n\n\nCohomology via sheaves\n\nNotes.\nThis is a week-long class from Mathcamp 2018 about Čech cohomology on graphs and cohomology computations for simple spaces. The class is designed in an IBL-format - you’re expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject. The prerequisites are linear algebra (over finite fields).\n\n\nHow curved is a potato?\n\nNotes.\nThis is a week-long class from Mathcamp 2018 about principal, Gaussian, and mean curvature of potatoes embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). The prerequisites are linear algebra, in particular, the notions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and multi-variable calculus.\n\n\nWould I ever lie group to you?\n\nNotes.\nI taught this week-long class at Mathcamp 2018. This is a class about matrix groups and how they arise as symmetries of spaces. The prerequisites are linear algebra and group theory, in particular, group actions.\n\n\nRiemann surfaces\n\nProblem Sets.\nI taught this week-long class at Mathcamp 2019. In this class, we construct Riemann surfaces as “graphs” of holomorphic functions. Towards the end we prove Fermat’s last theorem for function fields. The prerequisites are complex analysis.\nThe following are a few other classes I taught at Mathcamp. The notes are not very polished.\n\nHow Riemann finally understood logarithms\nHow to glue donuts\nAll things manifoldy\nEuler Characteristic\nSymmetries of Spaces"
