  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>I’ve been blogging for as long as I can remember, starting from the early days of Blogger, Wordpress, and Tumblr, to the newer self-hosted realms of Github, Jekyll, and Hugo. Now that I’m entering a new phase of my life at JHU, here I am once again. I plan to write about the topics that currently occupy my thoughts: math, <s>teaching</s> learning, Lean, programming, philosophy of mind, books, movies, and more…</p>
<p>For me, writing serves as a way to clarify my thoughts while staying honest and consistent. As the wise Feynman once said “<em>The first principle is not to fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.</em>” Expressing your thoughts and putting them out in the world (for nobody to read) is the first step towards that.</p>
<p>The title of this post is a meditation prompt by Sam Harris. I’m serious about practicing meditation and mindfulness, but regrettably, not very good at it. Whenever I catch myself doing something I would rather not (like procrastinating writing), I just remind myself to <em>Begin Again</em>.</p>
<p>So here’s to not fooling yourself and to new beginnings.</p>
