<p>I’ve always been fascinated by the history of mathematics. Some of the classic and dramatic discoveries I read a kid were those of non-Euclidean geometry, Galois theory, the proof of Fermat’s last theorem, as well as Cantor and Gödel’s breakthroughs in logic. However, some of the more commonplace achievements, such as the invention of calculus by Newton and its subsequent formalization a century later through <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon%20%5Cdelta"> proofs, also possess a very intriguing narrative that involves not only mathematicians but also philosophers and theologians<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to come across the following resources for learning mathematical concepts through historical sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/projects.php">https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/projects.php</a></li>
<li><a href="https://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/triumphs/">https://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/triumphs/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently, these resources are part of an NSF-funded project known as <a href="https://blogs.ursinus.edu/triumphs/">TRIUMPHS</a>. I hope I find the time to read through with these materials.</p>

  <title>Begin Again</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>I’ve been blogging for as long as I can remember, starting from the early days of Blogger, Wordpress, and Tumblr, to the newer self-hosted realms of Github, Jekyll, and Hugo. Now that I’m entering a new phase of my life at JHU, here I am once again. I plan to write about the topics that currently occupy my thoughts: math, <s>teaching</s> learning, Lean, programming, philosophy of mind, books, movies, and more…</p>
<p>For me, writing serves as a way to clarify my thoughts while staying honest and consistent. As the wise Feynman once said “<em>The first principle is not to fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.</em>” Expressing your thoughts and putting them out in the world (for nobody to read) is the first step towards that.</p>
<p>The title of this post is a meditation prompt by Sam Harris. I’m serious about practicing meditation and mindfulness, but regrettably, not very good at it. Whenever I catch myself doing something I would rather not (like procrastinating writing), I just remind myself to <em>Begin Again</em>.</p>
<p>So here’s to not fooling yourself and to new beginnings.</p>
