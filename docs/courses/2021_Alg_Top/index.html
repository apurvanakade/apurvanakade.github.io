            <h3>Exams</h3>The final exam will be an oral exam
            conducted on Zoom. Students are required to have some
            means of showing their work on Zoom e.g. a tablet or a
            webcam.

            <h3>Homework</h3>There will be weekly homework in this
            course posted every Thursday after class. Students will
            be required to type up their solutions in LaTeX.
            Instructions for uploading the homework will be posted
            along with the homework set.<br>
            <br>
            There will be no deadline extensions. The lowest
            homework grade will be dropped.

            <h3>Final paper / project</h3>This part of the
            evaluation is to be construed very broadly. Students
            are encouraged to find topics that interest them
            personally. Here are some instructions for the final report:
            <ol type="1">
              <li>The report should be [5 - &epsilon;, 10 + &epsilon;] pages long (in standard latex font).</li>
              <li>It should be written in a definition-theorem-proof-examples format.</li>
              <li>The grading will be similar to the homework - you'll be graded for the details and not ideas.</li>
              <li>You'll have to upload your reports on gradescope before the last day of classes (<b>April 12</b>).</li>

              The classes will be held online over Zoom. Students
              are required to attend the lectures under their full
              legal name and to have their webcams on. If a student
              is unable to do so, they must obtain prior written
              permission of the instructor.

            <div class="subsection-body">
              Algebraic topology is the study of topological spaces
              using tools of an algebraic nature, such as homology
              groups, cohomology groups and homotopy groups. It is
              one of the major cornerstones of mathematics and has
              applications to many areas of mathematics and to
              other fields, such as physics, computer science, and
              logic. This is a first course in algebraic topology
              which will introduce the invariants mentioned above,
              explain their basic properties and develop geometric
              intuition and methods of computation.<br>
              <br>
              Here is a brief list topics covered in this course:
              Homotopy, fundamental group, Van Kampen's theorem,
              covering spaces, simplicial and singular homology,
              homotopy invariance, long exact sequence of a pair,
              excision, Mayer-Vietoris sequence, degree, Euler
              characteristic, cell complexes, projective space.
              Time permitting we might talk about cohomology and
              homotopy. Applications include the fundamental
              theorem of algebra, the Brouwer fixed point theorem,
              division algebras, and invariance of domain.

          <h2><strong>Accommodation</strong>
          <strong>P</strong><strong>ol</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>es</strong></h2>

          <p>Students with disabilities work with Accessible
          Education (formerly SSD) which provides recommendations
          for accommodation based on medical documentation or
          psychological and cognitive testing. The Academic
          Accommodation for Students with Disabilities policy can
          be found at:</p>

          <h2><strong>Academic Consideration for Student
          Absence</strong></h2>

          <p>Students will have up to two (2) opportunities during
          the regular academic year to use an on-line portal to
          self-report an absence during the semester, provided the
          following conditions are met: the absence is no more than
          48 hours in duration, and the assessment for which
          consideration is being sought is worth 30% or less of the
          student&rsquo;s final grade. Students are expected to
          contact their instructors within 24 hours of the end of
          the period of the self-reported absence, unless noted on
          the syllabus. Students are not able to use the
          self-reporting option in the following circumstances:</p>

          <ul class="squarelist">
            <li>for exams scheduled by the Office of the Registrar
            (e.g., December and April exams)</li>

            <li>absence of a duration greater than 48 hours,</li>

            <li>assessments worth more than 30% of the
            student&rsquo;s final grade,</li>

            <li>if a student has already used the self-reporting
            portal twice during the academic year.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If the conditions for a Self-Reported Absence are
          <em>not</em> met, students will need to provide a Student
          Medical Certificate if the absence is medical, or provide
          appropriate documentation if there are compassionate
          grounds for the absence in question. Students are
          encouraged to contact their Faculty academic counselling
          office to obtain more information about the relevant
          documentation.</p>

          <p>Students should also note that individual instructors
          are not permitted to receive documentation directly from
          a student, whether in support of an application for
          consideration on medical grounds, or for other reasons.
          <strong>All documentation required for absences that are
          not covered by the Self-Reported Absence Policy must be
          submitted to the Academic Counselling office of a
          student's Home Faculty.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Religious Accommodation</h2>

          <p>Students should consult the University's list of
          recognized religious holidays, and should give reasonable
          notice in writing, prior to the holiday, to the
          Instructor and an Academic Counsellor if their course
          requirements will be affected by a religious observance.
          Additional information is given in the Western
          Multicultural Calendar:</p>

          &nbsp;</p>

          <p>You may also be eligible to write the Special Exam if
          you are in a &ldquo;Multiple Exam Situation&rdquo; (see
          <span><a href=

          http://www.registrar.uwo.ca/examinations/exam_schedule.html</a></span>).</p>

          <p>If a student fails to write a scheduled Special
          Examination, the date of the next Special Examination (if
          granted) normally will be the scheduled date for the
          final exam the next time this course is offered. The
          maximum course load for that term will be reduced by the
          credit of the course(s) for which the final examination
          has been deferred. See Academic Calendar for details
          (under <span><a href=

          <p>Scholastic offences are taken seriously and students
          are directed to read the appropriate policy,
