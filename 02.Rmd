# For Students 

## Recommendation Letters

This section contains advice for people asking for a letter of recommendation from me.

I understand that asking for a recommendation letter can be unnerving and daunting. As a student, you might even be unsure as to whether you can ask me for a letter. Please understand that *letter-writing is one of my most important duties*. If you were in any of my classes and received a *decent* grade, you are entitled to get rec letters from me. You do not have to have "interacted" with me or "participated" in the lecture in any way. Having said that, if I do not know you personally or if you do not provide me enough time/information, my rec letter would be extremely short, just describing your scores in the course. 

### How to ask for a rec letter

**It is in your interest to make your letter writer's job as easy as possible.**
    
  - Timeline: 
    - Please give me as much notice as possible so I can write as detailed a letter as I would like. At least a month is reasonable. Any shorter notice, and you should expect a brief, superficial letter.

  - Email:
    - Send a formal email request. I'll neglect any other kind of messaging (including "oral requests").
    - Include all the information *in a single email* (see below).
    - Minimize the number of email interactions necessary. 

  - Documents: 
    - Create a shared folder for your documents and include the sharing link in the email. This way, I'll always have an updated copy of your statements. 
    - Provide as much information as you think might be relevant. More information is always preferred to less. Here are some common documents to share (drafts are acceptable):
      - A document/email will all the deadlines
      - CV 
      - Unofficial transcripts
      - Statement of Purpose 
      - Cover letter(s)
      - Program information 
      - Upload instructions

  - Reminders:
    - It's ok to send reminders. In fact, I encourage you to send me a reminder email a week before a deadline.
    - Verbal reminders are useless. Send your reminder by email. 



## Math Notes {-}


I love to design and teach new, and sometimes old, courses.
Below are notes and problem sets from several of my courses.
Most notes are accessible to undergraduate and advanced high-school students.

  [Problem Sets.](https://github.com/apurvnakade/uwo2021-algebraic-topology/tree/main/output)

  In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology aimed at graduate students and upper-level undergrads.
  The main textbook for the course was [Hatcher](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html) but I rarely used the book at all.
  The course covers the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology.

  In Fall 2020, I taught a semester-long at UWO on Discrete Math aimed at second-year undergrads majoring in computer science. The course was _fully asynchronous_ and I had to come up with several innovations to make it work.
  I curated a textbook on [zyBooks] and created several [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN) to accompany the text. I used [Piazza] as a platform for discussions.
  With a lot of help from my department, we also created hundreds of questions on [WeBWork] which were then used the exams.
  This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding course I've ever taught.
