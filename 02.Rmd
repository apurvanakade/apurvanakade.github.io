# Math Notes {-}


I love to design and teach new, and sometimes old, courses.
Below are notes and problem sets from several of my courses.
Most notes are accessible to undergraduate and advanced high-school students.


## UWO {-}


### Algebraic Topology {-}

[Problem Sets.](https://github.com/apurvnakade/uwo2021-algebraic-topology/tree/main/output)

In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology aimed at graduate students and upper-level undergrads.
The main textbook for the course was [Hatcher](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html) but I rarely used the book at all.
The course covers the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology.

### Discrete Math {-}

$$
\begin{align}
\left|\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\right|=\sum _{i=1}^{n}|A_{i}|-\sum _{1\leqslant i<j\leqslant n}|A_{i}\cap A_{j}|+\sum _{1\leqslant i<j<k\leqslant n}|A_{i}\cap A_{j}\cap A_{k}|-\cdots +(-1)^{n-1}\left|A_{1}\cap \cdots \cap A_{n}\right|
\end{align}
$$

In Fall 2020, I taught a semester-long at UWO on Discrete Math aimed at second-year undergrads majoring in computer science. The course was _fully asynchronous_ and I had to come up with several innovations to make it work.
I curated a textbook on [zyBooks] and created several [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN) to accompany the text. I used [Piazza] as a platform for discussions.
With a lot of help from my department, we also created hundreds of questions on [WeBWork] which were then used the exams.
This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding course I've ever taught.

This week-long class from Mathcamp 2019 covers (pun intended) the covering space theory for graphs and surfaces and is meant to be an introduction to algebraic topology and its connection to group theory. The prerequisites are group theory and basic minimal exposure to topology/analysis.

### From High School Arithmetic to Group Cohomology {-}

This is a week-long class from Mathcamp 2019 based on a fun paper by Dan Isaken titled   [A cohomological viewpoint of elementary school arithmetic](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3072368?seq=1).
It introduces the notions of group extensions and exact sequences as means to interpret addition of multi-digit numbers.
It is designed in an IBL-format - you're expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject.
The prerequisites are group theory.

In this class, we construct Riemann surfaces as "graphs" of holomorphic functions.
Towards the end we prove Fermat's last theorem for function fields.
The prerequisites are complex analysis.
