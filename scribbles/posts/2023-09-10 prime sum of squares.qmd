I came across this "one sentence" proof that every prime congruent to 1 mod 4 can be written as a sum of two squares:

[https://doi.org/10.2307/2323918](https://doi.org/10.2307/2323918)

The proof involves constructing a cryptic involution on a set of numbers and showing that the involution has exactly one fixed point. 
The details do not seem too hard to check.
The real question is - how did the authors come up with this involution?
