Fun for me is [reading books] and writing on [my blog] about random
things. I love to [travel]. I type in [dvorak].

I love to design websites like this one, and [my blog\'s theme]
using [Hugo]. I have also started a couple of wikis for dumping [math-ed
resources] and [computer hacks]. 

In a past life I was involved with and highly recommend the following:

-   London, ON
    -   [Yoga Shack]
    -   [West Coast Swing]

-   Baltimore
    -   [Yogaworks]
    -   [Hiking at JHU]
    -   [Climbing at JHU]
    -   [Argentine Tango]
    -   [JHU Ballroom Club]
    -   [Mobtown Ballroom]
    -   [Baltimore Bike Party]
    -   [Baltimore Improv Group]
