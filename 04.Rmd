# Professional Programs {-}

Following are some programs that have helped me greatly on my journey of becoming a math educator:

## DRP {-}

The Directed Reading Program is a program in which undergrads are paired with a graduate student/postdoc whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester.
It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting.

I've helped start and organize the [DRP at UWO] and in the past have co-organized the [DRP at JHU].
If you are interested in participating in the DRP or would like to run one at your university, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Following is the list of projects I've mentored in the past.

- Clare Bedford, Surreal Numbers. ([UWO, Winter 2021])
- Jacob Fabe, Fundamental Group from Topology by Munkres. ([UWO, Fall
  2020])
- Tim Yau, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. ([UWO, Fall
  2019])
- Hannah Wool, Topology by Munkres. ([JHU, Spring 2019])
- Sydney Timmerman, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Mari√°n Fecko. ([JHU, Fall 2018])
- Eric Cochran, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. ([JHU,
  Spring 2018])
- Chris Chia, The Knot Book by Adams Collins. ([JHU, Fall 2017])

## Canada/USA Mathcamp {-}

[Canada/USA ![Mathcamp](images/mathcamp-icon.png)](https://www.mathcamp.org/) is an intensive 5-week-long <strike>summer program</strike> cult for mathematically talented high school students.
I was fortunate to be able to participate in this amazing place for four summers.
Here, I had the unique opportunity to constantly experiment with my teaching and I learned a lot from my fellow educators and students.
If you are a high-school student/graduate student interested in Canada/USA Mathcamp, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for information.
Below are notes from some of the classes I designed and taught at Mathcamp.

## Teaching Academy, JHU {-}

I took a semester long course at the [Teaching Academy] at JHU while I was a graduate student.
The Teaching Academy offers Ph.D. students and Post-doctoral Fellows from all divisions across Johns Hopkins University, college teacher training and academic career preparation opportunities through courses, workshops, teaching practicums, teaching-as-research fellowships, and individual consultation.
This program exposed me to the concept of teaching as an intellectual endeavor and really got me interested in my current career as a math educator.

## Project NExT, MAA {-}

Mathematical American Association's [Project NExT] (New Experiences in Teaching) is a professional development program for new or recent Ph.D.s in the mathematical sciences. It addresses all aspects of an academic career: improving the teaching and learning of mathematics, engaging in research and scholarship, finding exciting and interesting service opportunities, and participating in professional activities. For me the greatest value of this program is the opportunity it provides to connect to with and learn from other math educators from all over the country.
