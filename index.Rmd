# Brief Introduction

I am a postdoc in the math department at the University of Western Ontario.
As a math educator, I consider cheap and easy accessibility of education as my primary motivation. 
I believe that higher education is a fundamental right and hence should be freely available to anyone who is willing to put in the time and the right kind of effort.
We now have the technological tools that can make this possible.
My computer engineering background puts me in a unique position to leverage these tools and use them to supplement (and not replace) math teachers everywhere. These can be used to create courses that can reach a much wider audience than was previously possible without comprising the quality of education.
I do not see online classes as being subpar to in-person classes. 
If anything, I see the current situation as an opportunity for us, math educators, to radically rethink our definition of a math classroom.
