I\'m a postdoc at the [University of Western Ontario] working with [Dan Christensen] and [Chris Kapulkin]. 
I do research in algebraic topology and homotopy theory.

In addition to research, I am very passionate about improving math education. I want to
modernize math-ed and bring it to the 21st century through the use of new technological innovations 
in teaching and in the process make it more accessible and equitable.

I\'m currently teaching [Math 2151A (Discrete Math for Engineers)].
