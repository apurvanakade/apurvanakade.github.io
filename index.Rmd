I am a postdoctoral lecturer in the [Math Department](https://www.math.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University. 
In Spring 2023, I'm

- Coordinating Math 290-3,
- Teaching Math 250,
- Working on [PreText](https://pretextbook.org/) and [WeBWorK](https://webwork.maa.org/) for Aaron Greicius' [linear algebra textbook](http://linear-algebra.northwestern.pub/frontmatter-1.html),
- Mentoring for the [Causeway Postbac Program](https://sites.northwestern.edu/causeway/),
- Trying to formalize math for [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib) in [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/).

When not doing math, you can find me doing yoga, running, reading, or exploring Chicago's West Coast Swing scene. Starting Fall 2023, I'll be a Senior Lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, Applied Mathematics and Statistics.
