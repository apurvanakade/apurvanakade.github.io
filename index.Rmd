# Apurva Nakade

<img src="images/me0.jpg" width="200px" class="right" />

I\'m a postdoc in the [Department of Mathematics] at the University of
Western Ontario working with [Dan Christensen] and [Chris Kapulkin].

In the Fall of 2020, I\'ll be teaching Math 2151A (Discrete Math for Engineers).

I work in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. My broad
interests are in understanding how homotopy theoretic tools can be used
to solve problems from other areas of math. 

While learning homotopy type
theory, I came across the [Lean theorem prover] and have since gotten
obsessed with it. 

I am also very interested in math education. I want to
modernize math education and bring it to the 21st century through the
use of new technological innovations in teaching and in the process make
it more accessible and equitable.
