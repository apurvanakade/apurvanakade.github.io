I\'m a postdoc at the [University of Western Ontario] working with [Dan Christensen] and [Chris Kapulkin]. 
I do research in algebraic topology and homotopy theory.

In addition to research, I am very passionate about improving math education. I want to
modernize math-ed and bring it to the 21st century through the use of new technological innovations 
in teaching and in the process make it more accessible and equitable.

Things that keep me busy these days: teaching [Math 2151A (Discrete Math for Engineers)], making [video lectures], organizing the [DRP].
