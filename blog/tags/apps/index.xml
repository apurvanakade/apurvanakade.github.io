      <description>I have always loved chaos. But sadly, I find myself surrounded by too much of it. With the tables turned, I find myself trying to find order in these chaotic times. Here&amp;rsquo;s what has helped me so far:
 OneNote Nebo on iPad + iPencil for keeping a daily journal Joplin for organizing notes Goodnotes for math Ticktick Google Keep for making daily checklists A very convenient Pomodoro timer Zoom meetings with friends and family Duolingo to keep myself busy Work  I really hope when this crisis ends (which I know is never) I can get back to complaining about too much order and wanting more chaos and anarchy.</description>
