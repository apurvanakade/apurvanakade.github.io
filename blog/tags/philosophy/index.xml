      <description>With every Camus book there are two major problems:
 The writing is purposefully contrived, possibly lost in translation from French. The meaning is purposefully contrived, possibly lost in translation from French.  In spite of this, I just cannot get enough of his books. He is the most enlightened person I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.
The Fall is the story of a benevolent lawyer who is always going out of his ways to help others, a hugely successful lawyer who offers his services to the poor for free.</description>

      <title>Crime and Punishment</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?&amp;quot;
 Crime and Punishment is Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s criticism of naive rationalism, utilitarianism, and armchair philosophizing. For such a boring topic, this is a surprisingly fun read. Adhering to his own criticism, Dostoevsky does not take to prophesying and making grand philosophical arguments about the pros and cons of communism but instead weaves an interesting and entertaining narrative of what might happen if one were to take rationalism to its extreme.</description>

      <title>Not Knowing</title>

      <description>Here&#39;s something I have been thinking about a lot lately, thanks mostly to my being on the internet almost constantly. We live in a world where we can just google the answer to many of the questions that arise in day-to-day life. This is great in that it is harder to lie about things and this increases equity and transparency in that one does not have to trust another person&amp;rsquo;s word blindly.</description>

      <title>Myth of Sisyphus</title>

      <description>“Man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.”  The central question, says Camus, is that of suicide. If you are going to die one day, why not just kill yourself now?
Starting from here, he develops the philosophy of the absurd.</description>
