      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an avid reader and there are quite a few books that have made me completely restructure my life and thinking. This is a relatively new phenomenon. It is only when I started facing a lot of uncertainty and conflict that I started to read and think more seriously and let what I read change me. These books have not been about facts or history or science or philosophy but rather about introspection and thinking.</description>

      <description>Whenever I become aware of some chaos in my mind, I try to follow my chain of thoughts to the source. This makes &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; just how tenuous and ridiculous most connections from one thought to the next are. The fickle mind crosses the flimsiest of bridges simply to fulfill its own need of constantly thinking something. Once your mind realizes just how ridiculous this all is and how embarrassing the source of all this chaos is, it automatically calms down.</description>

      <description>I had been thinking on and off about free will for some time now. To anyone who has some time to think, the pandemic is bound to raise some serious questions about control and free will. The following marathon conversation between Lex Fridman and Sam Harris rekindled my interest in the subject.
  Do humans have free will?
At the most fundamental level, the answer has to be no as we are all bound by the laws of physics.</description>

      <description>I often take long walks and think about things while walking. Being a mathematician, I have a tendency to figure things out in my head. While this works great most of the time, there are occasions when this causes me a great deal of anxiety and frustration. As life becomes more complex, the latter situation is only becoming more frequent.
I used to think that this has to do with overthinking but I no longer believe that it is possible for the brain to overthink.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;You are right, Watson,&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;It does seem a most preposterous way of settling a dispute.&amp;quot;
  &amp;ldquo;Most preposterous!&amp;rdquo; I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement&amp;rdquo; - Adventures of the Cardboard Box
 Sherlock Holmes might have been able to predict the thoughts of Dr. Watson but I have found out that predicting my own thoughts is enough of a challenge for me.</description>

      <description>Meditation sucks at first. It sucks badly for a long long time. It is SO bad, SO sucky. The harder you try the more you suck at it. But it is hubris to assume that you would naturally be an expert at it. I have been trying it on and off unsuccessfully for many years. Only now, thanks to the lockdown, I have finally been able to do it consistently and have started liking it.</description>

      <description>An idea from psychology I really like is the four stages of competence. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt directly from Wikipedia:
   Unconscious incompetence. The individual does not understand or know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the deficit. They may deny the usefulness of the skill. The individual must recognize their own incompetence, and the value of the new skill, before moving on to the next stage.</description>
