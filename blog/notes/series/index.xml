      <description>I love the adaptations of graphic novels. I love contrasting and comparing the two art forms and seeing how they bring out completely different aspects of the same story.
The comics are a collection of short stories whereas the series is closer to a novel. In the comics, the characters have very singular personality traits. They are caricatures and not recognizable as human beings. All of them are extremely damaged and there is a singular desire or a past trauma that determines their actions.</description>

      <description>I have always loved sci-fi. I love sci-fi more than I love actual science. Sci-fi is hardly ever about science. It is imaginative and fantastic. It is always about people. For exactly this reason, Dark is a fantastic sci-fi. In its three seasons, the lives of its handful characters get deeply and inextricably intertwined and the actors performing these roles give candid performances that makes all the chaos thoroughly believable.</description>

      <description>I am fascinated by Japan, the country that has produced Naruto, Bleach, Akira, Ghost in the shell, Murakami, Ishiguro, Miyazaki and so much more. An inward-looking, closed island riddled with lost youth and a dying population that has somehow managed to preserve its culture in the present and has had so much influence on the world. It is mystical, fantastic, spiritual, and simultaneously one of the biggest purveyors of porn.</description>

      <description>Every day for the past few months I would excitedly look forward to my work commute across this dreary city; I was listening to Malcolm Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s Revisionist History. As I was fiddling around with the various podcast apps trying to find one that I could use while driving without getting myself into an accident (whatever happened to intuitive design?), I accidentally started listening to the series in the reverse order. Fortuitously for me, these episodes were The Queen of Cuba and The Obscure Virus Club and they got me hooked real fast.</description>

      <title>Russian Doll</title>

      <description>Russian Doll is a modern day interpretation of the Groundhog Day. While the theme itself is quite clich√© and played out, Russian Doll brings in Netflix&amp;rsquo;s awesome production to create a mostly enjoyable series. With eight short episodes this is basically the length of a long movie, perfect length which prevents the series from feeling draggy. It&amp;rsquo;s short enough that it does not have to delve deeply into philosophy but long enough for the characters to evolve organically.</description>
