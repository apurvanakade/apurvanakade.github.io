Brief Background
========================

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at University of Western Ontario (UWO) working in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory.
I completed my PhD at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. Nitu Kitchloo.
In my thesis, I applied homotopy theoretic techniques to study problems from differential geometry.
I have been teaching and TAing university-level courses since 2014 first as a graduate student and now as a postdoctoral fellow. 

In addition to my regular teaching activities, I have been a co-organizer and mentor for Directed Reading Programs at JHU and UWO for the past three years. 
I have also been a mentor and an academic coordinator at the [Canada/USA Mathcamp](https://www.mathcamp.org/), a summer camp for mathematically talented high school students.
