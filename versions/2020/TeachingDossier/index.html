    <h1 id="brief-background">Brief Background</h1>
<p>I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at University of Western Ontario (UWO) working in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory.
I completed my PhD at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. Nitu Kitchloo.
In my thesis, I applied homotopy theoretic techniques to study problems from differential geometry.
I have been teaching and TAing university-level courses since 2014 first as a graduate student and now as a postdoctoral fellow. </p>
<p>In addition to my regular teaching activities, I have been a co-organizer and mentor for Directed Reading Programs at JHU and UWO for the past three years. 
I have also been a mentor and an academic coordinator at the <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>, a summer camp for mathematically talented high school students.</p>

    <h1 id="teaching-philosophy">Teaching Philosophy</h1>
<p>This 1- to 2-page statement describes your beliefs about teaching and how these influence the way you teach (i.e., why you make the pedagogical decisions that you do). Please see the <a href="https://teaching.uwo.ca/awardsdossiers/teachingphilosophy.html">Writing a Teaching Philosophy Statement</a> web page for advice on preparing your teaching philosophy statement and examples.</p>
