        I work in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory.
        I have been working on the following projects.

                      This project is a continuation of my PhD Thesis. The goal is to extend embedding calculus to an equivariant setting for manifolds with group actions.

                    I got serendipitously involved in this project thanks to an
                    <a href="http://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/2019MRC-Geometry">MRC Workshop</a>.
                    The goal of this project is to find a 2-categorical interpretation of some of naturally occuring objects (Drinfield double of a group) in mathematical physics and extend them using ideas from Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology.

                    This was my PhD thesis, in which I applied homotopy theoretic techniques to study problems for differential geometry.
                    Here is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07670" class="external-link">the paper</a> (submitted to Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures) based on the <a href="docs/PhD Thesis.pdf">Thesis</a> <small>(Updated on: May 07, 2019)</small>.
                    Here are some notes [<a href="docs/2019 - OSU Conference.pdf">1</a>], [<a href="docs/2019 - Thesis Defense.pdf">2</a>] from the talks I gave on this topic.
