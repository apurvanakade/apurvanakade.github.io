  <div class="post"><p>teaching is a complex process.
where i&rsquo;m using the word complex in the same way that atul gawande uses in <a href="https://apurvanakade.github.io/blog/reviews/books/checklist-manifesto/">the checklist manifesto</a>.
there are so a lot of moving parts from planning to execution and a lot of room for error.
sometimes small changes have large effects and sometimes a huge effort goes to complete waste.</p>
<p>the way university math education currently works is that it is taken as self-evident that someone who is good at math is going to excel at teaching.
this is how i started teaching. i just improvised.
fortunately, i am some training (and dare i say talent) at doing <a href="https://apurvanakade.github.io/blog/journal/improv/">improv comedy</a> so things have worked out well for me so far.
by design, improv comedy works only works on a small scale.
more nuanced approaches toward comedy, like stand-up or sketch, require a lot of planning and practice.</p>
<p>the same is true with teaching.
you can improvise in the beginning but if you want to be good at it you have to plan, plan and plan.
i have been planning quite a lot of courses for the past few years on various scales.
but i am realizing that i need to experiment, document, reflect, and analyze more systematically.</p>
<p>enter this blog.
i recently started a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Math-Wiki-01783c0807aa4fa18d7d28a7f724fcde">math-ed wiki</a> to dump resources and now i&rsquo;m starting this blog to dump my ideas, strategies, observations, and results.</p>
