      <description>I was going to write a long rant about how much i despise north american math textbooks but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that for later. I&amp;rsquo;ll just say that if I had studied math using these books I&amp;rsquo;d probably never have decided to pursue it as a career.
I&amp;rsquo;m very glad that one of the casualties of this pandemic is going to be the calculus textbook (and its siblings). While planning for this course I came across several online textbooks that I plan to explore in detail sometime.</description>
