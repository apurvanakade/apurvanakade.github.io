      <description>I was going to write a long rant about how much i despise north american math textbooks but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that for later. I&amp;rsquo;ll just say that if I had studied math using these books I&amp;rsquo;d probably never have decided to pursue it as a career.
I&amp;rsquo;m very glad that one of the casualties of this pandemic is going to be the calculus textbook (and its siblings). While planning for this course I came across several online textbooks that I plan to explore in detail sometime.</description>

      <description>Teaching is a complex process. Where i&amp;rsquo;m using the word complex in the same way that atul gawande uses in the checklist manifesto. There are so a lot of moving parts from planning to execution and a lot of room for error. Sometimes small changes have large effects and sometimes a huge effort goes to complete waste.
The way university math education currently works is that it is taken as self-evident that someone who is good at math is going to excel at teaching.</description>
