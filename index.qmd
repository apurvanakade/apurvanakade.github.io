# Hi! 

I'm a Senior Lecturer in the Applied Math & Stats department <!-- why is Math singular but Stats plural? --> at Johns Hopkins University. <br />
How to pronounce my name: *Ap* as in **ap**art, *u* as in m**oo**n, *rva* as in cu**rve**. 


I invest the majority of my mental energy in seeking ways to improve math education, both within my courses and on a broader scale.
My academic interests and experience span a wide range in Math, CS, and Math Education. 
I've also work in the field of math formalization using the [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover-community.github.io/). 
<!-- I thoroughly enjoy discussing all these topics. 
Whether you're a student, mathematician, or educator, please feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:apurva.nakade@jhu.edu) without hesitation. -->
