# Hi!

I'm a Senior Lecturer in the Applied Math & Stats department <!-- why is Math singular but Stats plural? --> at Johns Hopkins University. 

I love to learn and am constantly trying to learn something new. My latest interest is math formalization using the Lean theorem prover. I am also deeply interested in the process of learning. Whenever I learn something new, I try to find ways to make the learning process easier for the next reader. 

I have several non-academics interests, all of which I take just as seriously: web design, yoga, meditation, philosophy of mind, reading, writing, dancing, hiking, backpacking.
