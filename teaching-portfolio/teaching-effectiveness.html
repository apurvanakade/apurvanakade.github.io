Midterm Check-in as the course is ongoing. There was no end of course
survey for the Winter 2019 semester because of Covid. The complete data,

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Student Comments</h2>
<p>This section contains selected comments left by students on instructor evaluation forms.</p>
<p><strong>Discrete Structures for Engineering, UWO 2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The instructor for this course has done a very good job, easy
communication between students and instructors is essential
especially this year, and he has done the best job out of all my
courses. I appreciate the work he has put into the course to ensure
that we get the most out of it</p></li>
<li><p>Professor Apurva is one of the rare professors that is excellent in
explaining mathematics using examples and helping build the
conceptual image in my mind. I am taking this course again because I
dropped it simply because I wasn’t understanding the basic concept
that the professor explained by using proof. Professor’s method of
using an iPad and explain videos is parallel to watching Khan
Academy. His explanations are clear and also states what is common
for some things we learn about in the real world and what is not. He
also gives boundaries about what a concept is and what it isn’t on
top of explaining the concept. And the PA activities do an excellent
job of visualising the imagined concept that Professor Apurva
sparked. We also utilize Piazza to communicate with friends and ask
questions. It is also especially useful for seeing what most
students are struggling with and try to attempt those problems
yourselves and also get an opportunity to answer if you do know the
solution.</p></li>
<li><p>While some of the material was at first a bit confusing, Professor
Nakade does an excellent job at explaining and giving examples
during his pre–filmed lectures that help a lot with my
understanding. Additionally, he adds comments that helps reassure
students that some material will take a long time to understand but
is doable with practice. Personally I find this very helpful as this
shows me that he recognizes when the course would be a little
difficult and tries to minimize the confusion and disappointment
students have when they don’t get it the first time. Furthermore,
the midterm evaluation was a very fair assessment and despite being
proctored differently, it seems like something we would likely
receive in an in–person evaluation and that is very much
appreciated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calculus I, UWO 2019</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You are easily the best professor I have had so far. I find that
your teaching methods are very effective in terms of fully
explaining and presenting the concepts of calculus, and the
integration of examples within the notes have been very helpful as
they relate to the questions given on webwork and the exams.</p></li>
<li><p>Instructor Nakade is always willing to help us solve any problems we
are stuck on or unsure of. He will make many efforts to make time to
meet with us outside of his office hours if we are unable to meet
him during those times, to provide us with as much help as he can
about any of the concepts covered in this class.</p></li>
<li><p>Apurva Nakade has so far been the best professor I have had. I
believe that his methods for teaching and leading a class is highly
effective in terms of presenting ideas and concepts in a way that
can be learned efficiently. The examples and homework provided have
been very helpful in preparation for the quizzes and exams, and his
direct communication with the students is extremely helpful and
effective. The notes are very structured and planned, and this level
of focus improves the ability of the students to learn from the
notes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Honors Single Variable Calculus, JHU 2018</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The course was heavily tailored to the students and was a good
introduction to proofs. It was pretty enjoyable, and I liked the
class structure. The professor was generally pretty helpful,
especially during office hours. I understand how to write
mathematical proofs much better and I feel more confident in my
understanding of calculus.</p></li>
<li><p>You learn a lot in this course in a very short period of time. The
deeper understanding of calculus and proofs. Working through
problems in class in groups. He makes himself available often for
office hours and is helpful during them. He made the homework sheets
himself and they are very well done and put together. The course
website with the accumulative note sheet is super helpful. There is
a lot of forgiveness in the grading, so it’s okay if you screw
something up.</p></li>
<li><p>Its a brilliant course thats very stimulating and provides you
detailed grounding in the proofs for calculus.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathcamp</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I loved Apurva’s enthusiasm for the subjects he taught! I like how
he connected everything to topology. It was really fun doing chat
blasts as well as breakout room activities because we were able to
stay engaged. Also, I appreciate that the problems we solved in
breakout rooms were relatively easy so we weren’t stuck, and then we
would have the remaining time to make more connections. Overall
Apurva is super cheery and fun to be around!</p></li>
<li><p>Apurva is an amazing teacher! His explanations are very clear and
easy to understand. He includes plenty of examples that support the
lecture. He has also been very helpful during TAU, guiding me
through any material I don’t completely understand and answering
questions. Apurva has also heavily contributed to the positive
atmosphere at Mathcamp. He is very friendly and his humor never
fails to make campers laugh.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though a lot of Apurva’s classes have been challenging for me,
he was still able to help me follow the material. He’s great at
explaining topics in math and is really good at making any idea feel
intuitive and finally make sense. He’s also very encouraging and
enthusiastic when explaining and happy to walk through a problem
slowly with you for any class. Finally, he’s super fun to talk to
about basically anything (math and otherwise) and is overall a
really friendly and approachable person.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Peer Comments</h2>
<p>In Winter 2020, I participated in the Teaching Mentor Program at UWO.
The Teaching Mentor Program is a cohort-based hands-on learning experience. Participants work with a group of 4-5 interdisciplinary graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to observe and offer feedback on one another’s teaching. Groups will meet multiple times over the semester to act as students in one another’s teaching demonstrations. My group had four participants whose feedback is attached here.</p>
