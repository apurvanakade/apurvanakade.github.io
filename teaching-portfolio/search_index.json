I believe that higher education is a fundamental right and should be freely available to anyone who is willing to put in the time and the right kind of effort. Figuring out how to provide cheap, easily accessible, and yet high-quality education is one of my primary motivations for being in academia. Too much sanity may be madness and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be! We now have the technological tools that can make this possible. I’m very passionate about the use of technology in education. My computer engineering background puts me in a unique position to leverage these tools and use them to supplement (and not replace) math teachers everywhere. These can be used to create courses that can reach a much wider audience than was previously possible without comprising the quality of education. I do not see online classes as being subpar to in-person classes. If anything, I see the current situation as an opportunity for us, math educators, to radically rethink our definition of a math classroom. 1.1 Teaching Philosophy Teaching Philosophy. The guiding principle for my teaching is ``the objective of education is learning, not teaching.’’ In my classrooms, I’m merely a coach and a facilitator and teach with the core philosophy that my primary goal is to provide my students with a welcoming and inclusive environment where experimentation is encouraged, and students aren’t penalized for making honest mistakes. I use active learning techniques in all my classes. I believe that the best way to learn math is through making mistakes, getting confused, and struggling toward a solution and a math classroom is a place for students, and even the instructor, to grow as mathematicians. My teaching experience ranges from creating advanced electives and short boot camp courses for small groups of students, managing and teaching in-person courses with several hundred students, and adapting extensive service courses for asynchronous education. I have taught topics spanning calculus, linear algebra, discrete math, proof checking using computers, manifolds, and topology. Online Teaching. My most exciting project has been the fully asynchronous Discrete Math course that I’m currently teaching, which has nearly 200 students. I’ve had to redevelop every aspect of the course from scratch to fit the current unprecedented situation. Because this is an overwhelming time for many students, my priority has been to alleviate student anxiety. I’ve spread out the grades more evenly throughout all assessments and have informed my students beforehand that the exams will test competence and not expertise. I maintain an active discussion forum on Piazza to develop a sense of an online community. Following design principles, I’ve made my course as easy to follow as possible, and all assignments, forums, exams, deadlines, textbook, video lectures, and course resources are available in one place. Over the summer, I explored several textbooks and chose an online one that allowed me to provide an active learning environment asynchronously. Each week, I make short introductory videos and embed them directly at the start of each section, along with learning objectives and any special comments. I assign weekly, short auto-graded assignments within the textbook, which provide immediate feedback. I maintain a blog to document and reflect upon my teaching. Students have been very receptive, and I have received a lot of positive feedback from them. For the exams, my focus has been on ensuring that students who do not cheat are not at a disadvantage while still ensuring that students’ mental health is not adversely affected by the pressures of online assessments. In a team consisting of me, my postdoc advisor, and two students, we created a randomized pool of hundreds of questions on WeBWork (open source platform supported by MAA). UWO. In the previous year, I taught in large coordinated courses where I was the sole point of contact for over 150 students. This challenging but rewarding learning experience taught me how to be more inclusive and considerate of students from very diverse backgrounds and to ensure that even those who had other priorities could benefit from learning math in whatever way possible. I made myself available by having many office hours, which often ended up having high attendance. I memorized as many of my students’ names as I could to connect with them on a personal level and more effectively coach when guiding them through worksheets; I learned this skill while teaching at a five-week summer program, Mathcamp, where I learned to memorize 120 students’ names in a short period. One of my students is now participating in the Directed Reading Program. Mentoring. At JHU, I participated in a Directed Reading Program (first as a mentor and later as a co-organizer) that pairs undergraduate students with graduate students/junior faculty to undertake independent study projects. After moving to UWO, I started a DRP chapter here with one of my colleagues’ help. Our motivation has slowly morphed from getting more students to major in math to building a thriving and welcoming undergraduate math community. These programs have been successful at both universities, and we’ve seen significant and continuing growth in student interest and participation. This semester I’m also organizing a small topology boot camp, a crash course on point-set topology for undergraduates who’ll be taking the graduate Algebraic Topology course that I’ll be teaching next semester. I am also helping out the graduate students at UWO start a math-circles styled outreach program for the local schools. We are aiming to reach students from less privileged schools in the city to get them interested in math. It has been quite a challenge, given the current circumstances, but we have been making slow but steady progress. Adhering to my principle of letting students figure things out for themselves, I’m participating in an advisory capacity, providing feedback and direction, and trusting the grad students to do the decision-making. JHU. At JHU, I was fortunate to be given an opportunity to develop and teach Honors Single Variable Calculus for two semesters. I developed and taught two intersession courses introducing non-math majors to algebraic topology and Galois theory. While preparing the materials from scratch, I learned a lot about looking at things from a student’s perspective. I structured all of these classes in an inquiry-based format where instead of listening to lectures students learned the material by solving worksheets. My goal was to get students to understand the messy process of discovery in math. The class size went up from 4 to 10 in the years I taught, and then close to 20 in the year after. USA/Canada Mathcamp. My biggest influences have come from being a mentor (2017-20) and an academic coordinator (2018) at the Canada/USA Mathcamp, a summer program for high school students. Mathcamp allowed me to be a part of a loving and caring community, surrounded by people who love math and love to teach it and excel at it. I took on an academic coordinator’s role to contribute back to Mathcamp, challenge myself, and learn more about teaching. The academic coordinators are responsible for designing and running all the educational activities, including inviting and hosting external visitors, planning a balanced five-week class schedule (nearly 100 classes), assigning (110) students to projects, and teaching. Commitment to Diversity. I am very much aware of the biases unconsciously ingrained in a math classroom culture, which discourages women and minorities. I became especially mindful of this at Mathcamp, where we have serious conversations about inclusiveness, especially as a part of the staff hiring committee. In my classroom, I try to mitigate these biases by deemphasizing the role of genius and discouraging aggressive competitiveness instead of encouraging persistence and hard work. I make sure that everyone gets a chance to speak in class and participate in the classroom. I try to educate myself on diversity issues by attending talks and reading books. Professional Development. I am a member of the Project NExT’20 cohort, a professional development program sponsored by the MAA for math educators at the university level. Participating in the summer workshop exposed me to a beautiful community of math educators from whom I hope to learn from in the long run. I’ve already found fellow Discrete Math educators with whom I share teaching tips on the MAA Connect forum. I have completed a certification course at the Teaching Academy at JHU, where I learned several critical pedagogical concepts such as inquiry-based learning, backward course design, learning objectives, etc. I regularly incorporate these into my teaching. I also attend the workshops and seminars organized at the Center for Teaching and Learning at UWO. Personal Experiences. I consider myself an avid learner and keen listener and observer. My current course design is influenced by the online courses I’ve taken on Coursera and Kaggle. I was introduced to active learning methods through a brilliant French language class I took during my grad school. I am a regular practitioner of yoga and (pre-Covid) improv comedy and various forms of dance. These non-academic interests help me take a holistic approach toward my pedagogy. My next big goal is to figure out ways to quantitatively self-assess my teaching and pedagogical effectiveness and concretely implement evidence-driven methodologies in my classrooms. I’m also interested in understanding how scale affects pedagogy and how psychological research insights can enhance student learning. The current situation calls for an educational revolution in both the philosophy and teaching techniques, which can only be achieved through a deliberate, long-term effort. I hope to be able to participate in this and even facilitate it in some meaningful way. "],

Discrete Structures for Engineering (UWO, Fall 2020) This is a full semester four-credit course offered to second-year software engineering students. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts in discrete math, such as logic, combinatorics, modular arithmetic. Students also learn to write proofs alongside problem-solving. I am the only instructor for this course, and my class has nearly 200 students. I had to adapt the course to fit an online mode of delivery. Calculus II for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (UWO, Winter 2020) This is a full semester four-credit course offered to all undergraduates but taken mostly by first-year undergraduates with STEM majors. This is the second half of a full-year calculus sequence in which students learn about integration, sequences, and series. This course is a more challenging variant in which, alongside problem-solving students, are also taught how to write proofs. The year I taught this course, we had more than 300 students divided into two sections. I was the instructor for one of the sections and was solely responsible for making weekly WebWork homework sets for both the sections and making exams alongside the course coordinator. The class regularly met for four hours every week. Calculus I for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (UWO, Fall 2019) This is a full semester four-credit course offered to all undergraduates but taken mostly by first-year undergraduates from all majors. This is the first half of a full-year calculus sequence in which students learn topics such as limits and differentiation. The year I taught this course, we had more than 1000 students divided into nine sections. I was the instructor for one of the sections with more than 150 students and was solely responsible for making weekly WeBWork homework and in-class quizzes and managing TAs for my section. The class regularly met for four hours every week. Topics in Category Theory (UWO, Fall 2019) This was a full semester reading course for math graduate students that I supervised. The students worked through the first chapter of Ravi Vakil’s Foundations of Algebraic Geometry and some chapters from Emily Riehl’s Category Theory in Context. The course was structured in an open-ended, self-inquiry format. I would assign reading assignments and meet the students individually every week to discuss their work and progress. Honors Single Variable Calculus (JHU, Fall 2018, 19) This is an experimental full semester four-credit course offered at JHU to first-year undergraduates. The course covers all of the first-year calculus and introduces students to proof writing. The course is the only course taught by graduate students. I taught this course for two semesters, and in both years, I designed the course materials from scratch. The class size went up from four to ten in the years I taught, and then close to twenty in the year after. Calculus II For Biology and Social Science (JHU, Summer 2019) This is an accelerated four-credit summer course offered to all undergraduates but taken mostly by first-year undergraduates and talented high school students. This course is intended to be taken by students as their final math course. It introduces them to various topics such as integration, differential equations, linear algebra, probability, and statistics. The year I taught, there were 21 students in the class. I was the only instructor for this course. The class regularly met for ten hours every week for four weeks and had weekly exams. Differential Equations with Applications (JHU, Summer 2015, 17) This is an accelerated four-credit summer course offered to all undergraduates but taken mostly by first-year undergraduates and talented high school students. In this course, students are taught various techniques to solve differential equations alongside applications to other fields. I have taught this course twice. In both years, I was the only instructor for this course, and there were approximately four students in the class. The class regularly met for four hours every week for four weeks and had weekly exams. Intersession courses (JHU, 2017, 2018) These are experimental 2-3 week long 1-2 credit courses offered by any grad student or faculty at JHU during the winter break. I designed and taught two IBL-styled courses titled Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology and Symmetries &amp; Polynomials. These courses were designed to give non-math majors a preview of some fun topics from Algebraic Topology and Galois theory. Online Linear Algebra (JHU, Summer 201four) This is an accelerated four-credit summer fully online course offered to all undergraduates but taken mostly by first-year undergraduates and talented high school students, which covered a semester-worth of material. I was one of the two instructors for this course, and there were approximately 90 students in the class. 2.2 Innovative Course Development 2.2.1 Discrete Structures for Engineering (UWO, Fall 2020) Over the summer, I had to adapt a regular Discrete Math course to an online asynchronous setting. While I was preparing for the course, my priority was to reduce student anxiety, simplify the course delivery as much as possible, and minimize the screen time for students. Textbook: I decided to abandon the traditional textbooks and chose an online one, called Zybooks, which had interactive components and provided students with immediate feedback. The book is also extremely comprehensive and contains copious amounts of auto-graded exercises, in addition to several practice problems, which I assign weekly to help keep students on track. Finally, the book is exceptionally configurable, both in terms of content and structure. The textbook can be found here: learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UWOMath2151ANakadeFall2020 Lectures: To minimize the amount of required screen-time for students, I made short videos for each topic instead of a long one for each lecture. Having a textbook that I knew would fill in the gaps left out by the short lectures was crucial for making this choice. I embed these video lectures directly within the textbook to provide a centralized resource to students, much like other online platforms such as Coursera and Kaggle. The video lectures are also available on YouTube at the following link: www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN Exam: I decided to use WeBWork to make exam problems. For this, I researched a lot about online testing platforms. I chose WeBWork because it is robust and reliable, and it allows for both internal randomizations within a question and randomization between questions. Having an extensive repository of questions enables me to create unique exams for every student. WeBWorK questions repository: With my postdoc advisor and two students’ help, we designed a repository of several hundred problems for discrete math on WeBWork. This repository is easily portable and can be adapted to any discrete math course. Furthermore, because WeBWorK is open-source this repository can be used by anyone freely Discussion forums: I realized early on that communication was going to be the key to this course’s smooth running. For this reason, I choose Piazza as a discussion forum to answer student questions and encourage them to answer each other’s problems. Piazza is very intuitive, easily searchable, and allows for anonymous posts. A demo of the discussion forum can be found here: https://piazza.com/demo_login?nid=kd1rr8nxc6z4b5&amp;auth=f76e59e Centralized access: With students getting overwhelmed with the onslaught of online tools, it was necessary to make easily accessible. For this, with a little bit of tweaking, I embedded all the above websites into the school’s LMS. 2.2.2 Honors Single Variable Calculus (JHU, Fall 2018,19) At JHU, I was fortunate to develop and teach Honors Single Variable Calculus for two semesters. This is an experimental full semester four-credit course offered at JHU to first-year undergraduates. The course covers all of the first-year calculus and introduces students to proof writing. This is the first course I had to design from scratch. In the years before mine, the course was mostly taught in a lecture format. I decided to transition to a fully inquiry-based format. For this, I took the suggested textbook for this course and converted it into weekly guided exercises. Because the classes were small, I often dynamically modified the course material to suit the class. Designing this course gave a profound insight into the process of student learning and helped me combat expert blind spots. The materials for this course can be found here: apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2018_Honors_Calc/ 2.2.3 Intersession courses (JHU, Winter 2017,2018) I taught two week-long intersession courses titled Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology and Symmetries &amp; Polynomials. I taught both of these courses in a flipped classroom format. I assigned students guided exercises, which they solved to learn more about the subject. What was both challenging and fun was that the students were not math majors, and so I had to remove all the mathematical jargon and could not even expect them to know how to write proofs. As such, I had to design my course around concrete examples and find easily accessible concepts. For Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology, I asked the students to read and present applications of algebraic topology to other fields of science of their choosing. We had several exciting conversations about things like applications of knot theory to protein folding and data science. The notes and the student presentations can be found here: [apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2017_h2g2_alg_top/index.html] In the Symmetries &amp; Polynomials course, I taught students group theory using permutations of elements and its connection to Galois theory using roots of polynomials. During class, I would divide students into groups of two or three to work on problems together. The problem sets for this course can be found here. 2.3 Directed Reading Programs The Directed Reading Program (DRP) is a program that pairs undergraduate students with graduate students for one-on-one independent studies over the course of a semester. The program was started at the University of Chicago but it is now running in several mathematics departments in the country. I started as a mentor for the DRP at JHU and then shifted to being a co-organizer. I also designed and maintained the website for the program. After moving to UWO, with one of my colleagues’ help, we started a DRP chapter here. Our motivation has slowly morphed from getting more students to major in math to build a thriving and welcoming undergraduate math community. So far, this program has seen much interest from undergraduates, and we have seen increased participation from both the mentor and the mentee sides. 2.4 Canada/USA Mathcamp I taught at an intensive, residential, five-week summer camp for mathematically talented high school kids for five summers. The academic day at the camp is filled with classes, talks, and office hours with more than 100 courses offered each summer, covering material typically only encountered in college or grad school. My non-teaching duties included living in the dorms with students as an RA, being an academic advisor, and advising students on which courses to take. More information can be found here. Mentor: I designed and taught week-long courses on advanced mathematical topics such as linear algebra, manifolds, Riemann surfaces, representation theory, computer-assisted theorem proving, and mentored several reading and coding projects. A defining feature of Mathcamp is that each student designs their own schedule (with the guidance of an academic advisor). As such, the courses need to be designed to be both interesting and challenging. This year I had the added challenge of doing this online. For this, I decided to create a hybrid coding/math course that introduced students to computer-assisted theorem proving. For my more traditional courses, I taught using Jamboard, which allowed students to scroll through the previous pages. Notes from my Mathcamp classes can be found here. Academic Coordinator: In the summer of 2017, I was one of the two academic coordinators at Mathcamp. The academic coordinators are responsible for designing and running all the educational activities, including inviting and hosting external visitors, preparing a balanced five-week class schedule (more than 100 classes), assigning (110) students to projects, teaching, and being a part of the hiring team.
