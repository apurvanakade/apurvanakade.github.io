Fun for me is [reading books]. I love to [travel]. I type in [dvorak].
I love designing websites like this one (built using [bookdown]), [my blog\'s theme]
(built using [Hugo]), and the [JHU DRP website].

I maintain several blogs and wikis:

- [Personal blog]
- [Blog about teaching]
- [Computer hacks]
- [Math-ed resources]

In a past life I was involved with and highly recommend the following:

-   London, ON
    -   [Yoga Shack]
    -   [West Coast Swing]

-   Baltimore
    -   [Yogaworks]
    -   [Hiking at JHU]
    -   [Climbing at JHU]
    -   [Argentine Tango]
    -   [JHU Ballroom Club]
    -   [Mobtown Ballroom]
    -   [Baltimore Bike Party]
    -   [Baltimore Improv Group]
