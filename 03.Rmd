# For employers

## Experience {-}
Before coming to Northwestern, I was a postdoctoral fellow at University of Western Ontario.
I'm a member of the [Project NExT](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next) Brown'20 cohort.
I have a [certification](https://cer.jhu.edu/teaching-academy/coc/overview) from the [Teaching Academy at JHU](https://cer.jhu.edu/teaching-academy/).
I was a mentor for [Canada/USA Mathcamp](https://www.mathcamp.org/) from 2017-2019 and an academic coordinator for the summer of 2018.

I completed my PhD from JHU in 2019 with a thesis titled [An application of the h-principle to Manifold Calculus]().
I have an MSc in Mathematics from Chennai Mathematical Institute and a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.


## Professional Development {-}

Following are some programs that have helped me greatly on my journey of becoming a math educator:

### DRP {-}

The Directed Reading Program is a program in which undergrads are paired with a graduate student/postdoc whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester.
It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting.

I've helped start and organize the [DRP at UWO] and in the past have co-organized the [DRP at JHU].
If you are interested in participating in the DRP or would like to run one at your university, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Following is the list of projects I've mentored in the past.

- Clare Bedford, Surreal Numbers. ([UWO, Winter 2021])
- Jacob Fabe, Fundamental Group from Topology by Munkres. ([UWO, Fall
  2020])
- Tim Yau, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. ([UWO, Fall
  2019])
- Hannah Wool, Topology by Munkres. ([JHU, Spring 2019])
- Sydney Timmerman, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Mari√°n Fecko. ([JHU, Fall 2018])
- Eric Cochran, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. ([JHU,
  Spring 2018])
- Chris Chia, The Knot Book by Adams Collins. ([JHU, Fall 2017])

### Canada/USA Mathcamp {-}

[Canada/USA ![Mathcamp](images/mathcamp-icon.png)](https://www.mathcamp.org/) is an intensive 5-week-long <strike>summer program</strike> cult for mathematically talented high school students.
I was fortunate to be able to participate in this amazing place for four summers.
Here, I had the unique opportunity to constantly experiment with my teaching and I learned a lot from my fellow educators and students.
If you are a high-school student/graduate student interested in Canada/USA Mathcamp, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for information.
Below are notes from some of the classes I designed and taught at Mathcamp.

### Teaching Academy, JHU {-}

I took a semester long course at the [Teaching Academy] at JHU while I was a graduate student.
The Teaching Academy offers Ph.D. students and Post-doctoral Fellows from all divisions across Johns Hopkins University, college teacher training and academic career preparation opportunities through courses, workshops, teaching practicums, teaching-as-research fellowships, and individual consultation.
This program exposed me to the concept of teaching as an intellectual endeavor and really got me interested in my current career as a math educator.

### Project NExT, MAA {-}

Mathematical American Association's [Project NExT] (New Experiences in Teaching) is a professional development program for new or recent Ph.D.s in the mathematical sciences. It addresses all aspects of an academic career: improving the teaching and learning of mathematics, engaging in research and scholarship, finding exciting and interesting service opportunities, and participating in professional activities. For me the greatest value of this program is the opportunity it provides to connect to with and learn from other math educators from all over the country.

## Research {-}

My research is in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. My broad
interests are in understanding how homotopy theoretic tools can be used
to solve problems from other areas of math.

### String structures, 2-group bundles, and a categorification of the Freed-Quinn line bundle {.unnumbered .unlisted}

[ArXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07571)

I got involved in this project thanks to the [MRC Workshop](http://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/2019MRC-Geometry).
2-groups are higher categorical variants of groups.
In this project, we provide a 2-categorical interpretation of some of naturally occurring objects (Drinfield double of a group) in mathematical physics and extend them using ideas from Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology. This is a joint work with Daniel Berwick-Evans, Emily Cliff, Laura Murray, and Emma Phillips.

### PhD thesis: An application of the $h$-principle to Manifold Calculus {-}

[Paper in *Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures*](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40062-020-00255-3) <br/>
[ArXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07670) <br/>
[Original Thesis](https://github.com/apurvnakade/PDFs/blob/main/assorted%20notes/Research/PhD%20Thesis.pdf) <br/>
[Notes from a talk](https://github.com/apurvnakade/PDFs/blob/main/assorted%20notes/Research/2019%20-%20OSU%20Conference.pdf) <br/>
[Thesis defense presentation](https://github.com/apurvnakade/PDFs/blob/main/assorted%20notes/Research/2019%20-%20Thesis%20Defense.pdf)

In my PhD thesis, I applied homotopy theoretic techniques to study problems for differential geometry. 
I showed that the technique of manifold calculus cannot be used to analyze the space of isosymplectic embeddings of symplectic manifolds.
This thesis also provides a broad class of examples of non-analytic embedding functors (in the sense of manifold calculus).

### Protein folding using Markov chains {-}

[Paper in Information Processing Letters, IPL4801](https://github.com/apurvnakade/PDFs/blob/main/assorted%20notes/Research/2012%20-%20Protein%20Folding.pdf)

During my undergrad, I briefly worked on a project analyzing a Markov chain model of protein folding. We showed that the mixing time of the Metropolis algorithm is not a decreasing function of the value of gap between the lowest and the second lowest energies.
This is joint work with Somenath Biswas.

### Projects that did not quite work out {-}

- 2-groups in HoTT
- Spectral lifts of Soergel bimodules, joint with V. Lorman
- Finding loop space structures in exotic Kac-Moody groups
- Equivariant Embedding Calculus
