# DRP

The Directed Reading Program is a program in which undergrads are paired with a graduate student/postdoc whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester.
It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting.

I've helped start and organize the [DRP at UWO] and in the past have co-organized the [DRP at JHU].
If you are interested in the DRP or would like to run one at your university, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
Following is the list of projects I've mentored in the past.

- Clare Bedford, Surreal Numbers. ([UWO, Winter 2021])
- Jacob Fabe, Fundamental Group from Topology by Munkres. ([UWO, Fall
  2020])
- Tim Yau, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. ([UWO, Fall
  2019])
- Hannah Wool, Topology by Munkres. ([JHU, Spring 2019])
- Sydney Timmerman, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Mari√°n Fecko. ([JHU, Fall 2018])
- Eric Cochran, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. ([JHU,
  Spring 2018])
