# DRP

The Directed Reading Program is a program for undergrads and grad students/postdocs.
Undergrads are paired with a mentor whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester.
It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting.

I've helped start the [DRP at UWO] and in the past have co-organized the [DRP at JHU].
If you are interested in the DRP or wanting to run one at your university, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
Following is the list of projects I've mentored.

- Clare Bedford, _Surreal Numbers_. ([UWO, Fall 2021])
- Jacob Fabe, _Fundamental Group_ from Topology by Munkres. ([UWO, Fall
