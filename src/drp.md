# DRP

The Directed Reading Program is a program for undergrads and grad students/postdocs.
Undergrads are paired with a mentor whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester.
It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting.
I co-organize the [DRP at UWO] and in the past have co-organized the [DRP at JHU].
Following is the list of projects I've mentored.

- Jacob Fabe, _Fundamental Group_ from Topology by Munkres ([DRP, Fall
  2020])
- Tim Yau, _An Introduction to Manifolds_ by Loring Tu. ([DRP, Fall
  2019][drp, fall 2020])
- Hannah Wool, _Topology_ by Munkres. ([DRP, Spring 2019])
- Sydney Timmerman, [*Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists*] by Mari√°n Fecko. ([DRP, Fall 2018])
- Eric Cochran, _An Introduction to Manifolds_ by Loring Tu. ([DRP,
