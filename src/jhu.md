## Symmetries \& Polynomials, Intersession '18

## Hitchhiker's Guide to Algebraic Topology, Intersession '17

For Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology, I asked the students to read and present applications of algebraic topology to other fields of science of their choosing. We had several exciting conversations about things like applications of knot theory to protein folding and data science. The notes and the student presentations can be found [here](https://apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2017_h2g2_alg_top/index.html).

Most of my time in Fall 2020 was spent designing and teaching an online Discrete Math course.
This involved making [youtube videos], making and editing [WeBWorK] problem sets, managing discussion forums, other standard course related chores, and not going insane.
I occasionally write about it on my [my wordpress blog].

## Symmetries & Polynomials

In the Symmetries & Polynomials course, I taught group theory using permutations of elements and its connection to Galois theory using roots of polynomials. The problem sets for this course can be found [here](https://apurvanakade.github.io/teaching-portfolio/drive.google.com/file/d/1dChuk8J7s31C8xGurzsbf988VORnyXgb/view).
I taught two week-long intersession courses titled Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology and Symmetries & Polynomials. I taught both of these courses in a flipped classroom format. I assigned students guided exercises, which they solved to learn more about the subject.

## Honors Single Variable Calculus

For Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology, I asked the students to read and present applications of algebraic topology to other fields of science of their choosing.

The notes and the student presentations can be found [here](https://apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2017_h2g2_alg_top/index.html).
This was an experimental full semester four-credit course offered at JHU to first-year undergraduates.
The course covered all of the first-year calculus and introduced students to proof writing.
This is the first course I had to design from scratch.
The materials for this course can be found [here](https://apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2018_Honors_Calc/).
