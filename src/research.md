My research is in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. My broad
interests are in understanding how homotopy theoretic tools can be used
to solve problems from other areas of math.

## 2-groups in Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology

I got involved in this project thanks to an [MRC Workshop]. 2-groups are
higher categorical variants of groups. The goal of this project is to
find a 2-categorical interpretation of some of naturally occurring
objects (Drinfield double of a group) in mathematical physics and extend
them using ideas from Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology.

## An application of the h-principle to Manifold Calculus

This was my PhD thesis. I applied homotopy theoretic techniques
to study problems for differential geometry. Here is [the paper] ([arXiv
version]) based on the [thesis].
Here are some notes [notes1], [notes2] from the talks I gave on this
topic.

## Protein folding using Markov chains

During my undergrad, I briefly worked on a project involving some
protein folding models using basic linear algebra.

## Projects that did not quite work out

- 2-groups in HoTT
