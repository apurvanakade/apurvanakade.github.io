I work in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. My broad
interests are in understanding how homotopy theoretic tools can be used
to solve problems from other areas of math.

## Proof Formalization

I have recently gotten interesting in teaching math to computers using [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/about/).
This is different from doing computations as here we are trying to teach math to computers the same way we understand it.

I taught a course about it at [Mathcamp 2020].

My primary interest in Lean is as a potential tool for teaching math proofs.
My secondary interest lies in combining machine learning and theorem proving.
These are very long term goals as the field of theorem proving, although rapidly growing, is still very nascent.

## 2-groups in Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology

I got involved in this project thanks to an [MRC Workshop]. 2-groups are
higher categorical variants of groups. The goal of this project is to
find a 2-categorical interpretation of some of naturally occurring
objects (Drinfield double of a group) in mathematical physics and extend
them using ideas from Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology.

## 2-groups in HoTT

I\'m trying to understand how to express and analyze 2-groups in
homotopy type theory. Homotopy type theory is a branch of logic that
encored homotopy equivalences into one of its fundamental axioms thereby
providing a natural formalism for describing homotopy theory.

## An application of the h-principle to Manifold Calculus

This was my PhD thesis, in which I applied homotopy theoretic techniques
to study problems for differential geometry. Here is [the paper] ([arXiv
version]) based on the [thesis] [(Updated on: May 07, 2019)]{.small}.
Here are some notes [notes1], [notes2] from the talks I gave on this
topic.

## Protein folding using Markov chains

During my undergrad, I briefly worked on a project involving some
protein folding models using basic linear algebra.
[Information Processing Letters, IPL4801].

## Projects that did not quite work out

- Spectral lifts of Soergel bimodules, joint with V. Lorman
- Finding loop space structures in exotic Kac-Moody groups
- Equivariant Embedding Calculus
