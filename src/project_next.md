# Project NExT, MAA

Mathematical American Association's [Project NExT] (New Experiences in Teaching) is a professional development program for new or recent Ph.D.s in the mathematical sciences. It addresses all aspects of an academic career: improving the teaching and learning of mathematics, engaging in research and scholarship, finding exciting and interesting service opportunities, and participating in professional activities. For me the greatest value of this program is the opportunity it provides to connect to with and learn from other math educators from all over the country.
