## Canada/USA Mathcamp

[Canada/USA ![Mathcamp](images/mathcamp-icon.png)](https://www.mathcamp.org/) is an intensive 5-week-long <strike>summer program</strike> cult for mathematically talented high school students.
I was fortunate to be able to participate in this amazing place for four summers.
Here, I had the unique opportunity to constantly experiment with my teaching and I learned a lot from my fellow educators and students.
If you are a high-school student/graduate student interested in Canada/USA Mathcamp, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for information.
Below are notes from some of the classes I designed and taught at Mathcamp.
