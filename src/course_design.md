# Course Design

I love to design and teach new, and sometimes old, courses.
While the math I teach is not necessarily new I believe that many of our _stardard ways_ of teaching a class are broken and I try to find innovative ways to teach the same content.

I've designed and taught several courses at the following places:

- [Canada/USA MathCamp]
- [UWO]
- [JHU]

[jhu]: JHU.html
