# Course Design

I love to design and teach new, and sometimes old, courses.
Below are notes and problem sets from several of my course.
Most notes are accessible to undergraduate and advanced high-school students.

### [Canada/USA Mathcamp](mathcamp.html)

- [Lean at MC2020](mathcamp.html#lean-at-mc2020)

- [Hitchhiker's Guide to Algebraic Topology, Intersession '17](jhu.html#hitchhikers-guide-to-algebraic-topology-intersession-17)

### [UWO](uwo.html#uwo)

Note that most notes have not been thoroughly proofread and are likely to contain typos.
