Directed Reading Program is a program for undergrads and grad students/postdocs.
Undergrads are paired with a mentor whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester. 
It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting.
I co-organize the [DRP at UWO] and in the past have co-organized the [DRP at JHU].
Following is the list of projects I've mentored.
-   Jacob Fabe, *Fundamental Group* from Topology by Munkres ([DRP, Fall
