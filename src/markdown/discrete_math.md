I made some [youtube videos] for the Discrete Math course I taught at UWO in Fall 2020.

Most of my time in Fall 2020 was spent designing and teaching an online Discrete Math course. 
This involved making [youtube videos], making and editing [WeBWorK] problem sets, managing discussion forums, other standard course related chores, and not going insane.
I occasionally write about it on my [my wordpress blog].
