Fun for me is [reading books]. I love to [travel]. I type in [dvorak].
I love designing websites like this one (built using [bookdown]), [my blog\'s theme]
(built using [Hugo]), and the [JHU DRP website].

I maintain a few blogs:

- [Personal blog]
- [Blog about teaching]
- [Computer hacks]
- [Math-ed resources]

In a past life I was involved with and highly recommend the following:

### London, ON

- [Yoga Shack]
- [West Coast Swing]

### Baltimore

- [Yogaworks]
- [Hiking at JHU]
- [Climbing at JHU]
- [Argentine Tango]
- [JHU Ballroom Club]
- [Mobtown Ballroom]
- [Baltimore Bike Party]
- [Baltimore Improv Group]
