[Canada/USA ![Mathcamp](images/mathcamp-icon.png)](https://www.mathcamp.org/) is an intensive 5-week-long summer program for mathematically talented high school students.
More than just a summer camp, Mathcamp is a <strike>vibrant community</strike> cult, made up of a wide variety of people who share a common love of learning and passion for mathematics.

I was fortunate to be able to teach several week-long courses at the amazing place that is Mathcamp.
Without a shadow of doubt, my teaching is highly influenced by my experiences at the camp.
Here I experimented a lot with my teaching and learned a lot from my fellow educators and students.

If you are a high-school student/graduate student interested in participating in/teaching at Mathcamp, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for information.
Below are some notes from some of the courses I taught at Mathcamp.

## Lean at MC2020

[Notes.](https://apurvanakade.github.io/courses/lean_at_MC2020/index.html)

<!-- [Lean theorem prover] is a proof checker that can check the correctness of mathematical proofs. -->
<!-- One can also think of it as a proof assistant that can be used to teach math to computers. -->
<!-- Proofs _written in Lean_ are unique in that they're both human and machine readable. -->
<!-- Furthermore, Lean has an [extremely active and helpful community](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) which makes learning Lean an "easy" and enjoyable experience. -->
<!-- [lean theorem prover]: https://leanprover-community.github.io/ -->

I taught this week long course at Mathcamp 2020 introducing students to Lean.
The course is completely interactive - you learn by solving exercises and coding snippets online.
The only prerequisites for this course are basic proof techniques, although it is recommended to simultaneously use the other resources linked in the notes.
Toward the end of the course we teach Lean the proof of irrationality of \\( \sqrt{2} \\).

## Crash Course on Linear Algebra

[Notes.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lnX4p_K75vMl0rt0JtOeTYPm9eA6Zi2j/view?usp=sharing)

I taught this week-long course at Mathcamp 2018 as a proof-based introduction to Linear Algebra.
The prerequisites for this course are basic proof techniques.
The course is complete in an IBL-format - you're expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next.
The notes are quite terse and challenging.

## Galois Correspondence of Covering Spaces

[Notes.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yMpw52rjMrBRj5q8W2PIDRDp9yXmDYVN/view?usp=sharing)

I taught this course at Mathcamp 2019. It is about the covering space theory for graphs and is meant to be an introduction to algebraic topology and its connection to group theory.
The prerequisites are group theory and basic exposure to topology/analysis.
