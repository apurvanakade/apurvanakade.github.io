## Algebraic Topology

[Problem Sets.](https://github.com/apurvnakade/uwo2021-algebraic-topology/tree/main/output)

In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology aimed at graduate students and upper-level undergrads.
The main textbook for the course was [Hatcher](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html) but I rarely used the book at all.
The course covered the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology.

## Discrete Math

In Fall 2020, I taught a semester-long at UWO on Discrete Math aimed at second-year undergrads majoring in computer science. The course was _fully asynchronous_ and I had to come up with several innovations to make it work.
I curated a textbook on [zyBooks] and created several [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN) to accompany the text. I used [Piazza] as a platform for discussions.
With a lot of help from my department, we also created hundreds of questions on [WeBWork] which were then used the exams.
This simultaneously the most challenging and the most rewarding course I've ever taught.
