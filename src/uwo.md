## Algebraic Topology

In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at [UWO] on Algebraic Topology aimed at graduate students and upper-level undergrads. The main textbook for the course was [Hatcher](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html) but I rarely used the book at all.

The homework for this course can be found here.

## Discrete Math

In Fall 2020, I taught a semester-long at [UWO] on Discrete Math aimed at second-year undergrads majoring in computer science. The course was _fully asynchronous_ and I had to come up with several innovations to make it work.

I _curated_ a textbook on [zyBooks] and created several [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN) to accompany the text. We used [Piazza] as a platform for asking questions and discussing math.
