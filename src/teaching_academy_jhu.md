# Teaching Academy, JHU

I took a semester long course at the [Teaching Academy] at JHU while I was a graduate student.
The Teaching Academy offers Ph.D. students and Post-doctoral Fellows from all divisions across Johns Hopkins University, college teacher training and academic career preparation opportunities through courses, workshops, teaching practicums, teaching-as-research fellowships, and individual consultation.
This program exposed me to the concept of teaching as an intellectual endeavor and really got me interested in my current career as a math educator.
