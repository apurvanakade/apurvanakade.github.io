[Teaching Evaluations.](https://github.com/apurvnakade/PDFs/tree/main/teaching%20evaluations)

I got my bachelor's in computer science and engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.
I did a masters in mathematics from Chennai Mathematical Institute followed by Ph.D. in mathematics from Johns Hopkins University.

I'm currently a postdoctoral lecturer at Northwestern University.
Before this, I was a postdoctoral fellow at University of Western Ontario.
I'm a member of the [Project NExT](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next) Brown'20 cohort.
I also have a [certification](https://cer.jhu.edu/teaching-academy/coc/overview) from the [Teaching Academy at JHU](https://cer.jhu.edu/teaching-academy/).

I was a mentor for [Canada/USA Mathcamp](https://www.mathcamp.org/) from 2017-2019 and an academic coordinator for the summer of 2018.
Below is a complete list of courses I've taught so far.
