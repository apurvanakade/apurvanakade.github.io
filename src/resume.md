I did my bachelor's in computer science and engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.
I did a masters in mathematics from Chennai Mathematical Institute followed by Ph.D. in mathematics from Johns Hopkins University.

Since 2019, I have been a postdoctoral fellow at University of Western Ontario.
Starting Fall 2021, I'll be a postdoctoral lecturer at Northwestern University.
I'm a member of the [Project NExT](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next) Brown'20 cohort. I also have a [Certificate of Completion](https://cer.jhu.edu/teaching-academy/coc/overview) from the Teaching Academy at JHU.

I was a mentor for Canada/USA Mathcamp from 2017-2019 and an academic coordinator for the summer of 2018.
Below is a complete list of courses I've taught so far.
