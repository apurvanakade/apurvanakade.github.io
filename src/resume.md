# Résumé

My detailed CV is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjjdAYYkMuSBC6xEMi96PKej3IxA25VC/view?usp=sharing). You can find teaching evaluations for my courses [here](https://tinyurl.com/nakade-evals).

I completed my PhD in Math at the Johns Hopkins University in 2019.
My PhD thesis is titled _Manifold Calculus and Convex Integration_ (more [here](./research.html)).

I have been teaching university level math courses for quite some time now.
I taught summer courses, semester-long courses, and intersession courses at JHU from 2014-19.
I taught semester-long courses at UWO from 2019-21.
I was a mentor for Canada/USA Mathcamp from 2017-2019 and an academic coordinator for the summer of 2018.

Below is a list of courses I've taught so far. You can find the course notes in [Course Design](./course_design.html).
