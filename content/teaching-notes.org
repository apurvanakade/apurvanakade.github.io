| Algebraic Topology | Winter 2021 |

** 2021 - Winter - UWO - Algebraic Topology
I taught an introduction to algebraic topology course in Winter 2021 at UWO. The homework for this course can be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/pnhsgyffnsqj

** 2020 - Fall - UWO - Discrete Math
I made some [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN][youtube videos]] for the Discrete Math course I taught at UWO in Fall 2020.

** 2018 - Fall - JHU - Honors Single Variable Calculus
I designed and taught an IBL-proof based Honors Single Variable Calculus course at JHU the notes of which can be found [[https://apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2018_Honors_Calc/index.html][here]].

** 2018 - Intersession - JHU - Symmetries and Polynomials
I designed and taught a no-prerequisite two week IBL course introducing students to the unsolvability of polynomials using Galois theory. Notes for the course can be found [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dChuk8J7s31C8xGurzsbf988VORnyXgb/view?usp=sharing][here]].

** 2017 - Fall - JHU - Honors Single Variable Calculus
I designed and taught a IBL-proof based Honors Single Variable Calculus course at JHU the notes of which can be found [[https://apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2017_Honors_Calc/index.html][here]].

** 2017 - Intersession - JHU - Hitchhiker's Guide to Algebraic Topology
I taught a two week course introducing non-math majors to algebraic topology. The notes can be found [[https://apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2017_h2g2_alg_top/index.html][here]].
