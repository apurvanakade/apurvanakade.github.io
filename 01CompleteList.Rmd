#### Calculus II for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (UWO, Winter 2020) {-}
was a full semester 4 credit course with more than 300 students divided into 2 sections. I was the instructor for one of the sections and was solely responsible for making weekly WebWork homeworks and making exams along with the course coordinator. The class regularly met for 4 hours every week.

#### Calculus I for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (UWO, Fall 2019) {-}
was a full semester course with more than 1000 students divided into 10 sections. I was the instructor for one of the sections and was solely responsible for making weekly WebWork homeworks and in-class quizzes. The class regularly met for 4 hours every week.

#### Topics in Category Theory (UWO, Fall 2019) {-}
was a full semester reading course for math graduate students that I supervised. We worked through Chapter 1 of Ravi Vakil's [*Foundations of Algebraic Geometry*] with some help from Emily Riehl's [*Category Theory in Context*].

#### Calculus II For Biology and Social Science (JHU, Summer 2019) {-}
was a month long summer course which covered semester-worth of material. The class regularly met for 10 hours every week and had weekly exams.

#### Differential Equations with Applications (JHU, Summer 2015, 17)
was a month long summer course which covered semester-worth of material. The class regularly met for 10 hours every week and had weekly exams.

#### Online Linear Algebra (JHU, Summer 2014) {-}
was a fully online two month long summer course which covered semester-worth of material. The class regularly met for 4-5 hours every week.
