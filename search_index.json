I am doing research in algebraic topology and homotopy theory. In addition to research, I am very passionate about improving math education. I want to modernize math-ed and bring it to the 21st century through the use of new technological innovations in teaching and in the process make it more accessible and equitable. Things that keep me busy these days: teaching Math 2151A (Discrete Math for Engineers), making video lectures, organizing the DRP, organizing the topology boot-camp, applying for jobs. "],
["me-math-machine.html", "Me, Math, Machine Learning to Lean Read more", " Me, Math, Machine I have recently gotten interesting in teaching math to computers using Lean. This is different from doing computations as here we are trying to teach math to computers the same way we understand it. Lean is an open-source software that understands mathematics and can check correctness of proofs. It was developed my computer scientists at Microsoft Research but has since been overtaken my mathematicians who now form the leanprover-community and maintain its rapidly growing math library. My primary interest in Lean is as a potential tool for teaching math proofs. My secondary interest lies in combining machine learning and theorem proving. These are very long term goals as the field of theorem proving, although rapidly growing, is still very nascent. Currently, I try to teach Lean to students and am working on contributing to Lean’s math library. Learning to Lean Lean is accessible to anyone who understands basic theorem proving in math. You can find several learning resources here. I personally learned Lean by playing the Natural numbers game, reading Theorem Proving in Lean, and banging my head against the wall while solving some problems on Codewars. However, online resources are not enough for learning the language. There is a very helpful and supportive Lean community on zulipchat where you can ask questions and get help to your heart’s content. The best way to learn is by teaching. And so, I taught a course Lean at MC2020 at Mathcamp 2020 where we taught Lean the proof of irrationality of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).

["teaching-notes.html", "Teaching Notes Directed Reading Program Canada/USA Mathcamp Johns Hopkins Expository Notes", " Teaching Notes This page contains notes from the various courses and projects I’ve taken, taught, or mentored. Directed Reading Program The Directed Reading Program is a program for undergrads and grad students/postdocs. Undergrads are paired with a mentor whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester. It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting. I co-organize the DRP at UWO and in the past have co-organized the DRP at JHU. Following is the list of projects I’ve mentored. Jacob Fabe, Fundamental Group from Topology by Munkres (DRP, Fall 2020) Tim Yau, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (DRP, Fall 2019) Hannah Wool, Topology by Munkres. (DRP, Spring 2019) Sydney Timmerman, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Marián Fecko. (DRP, Fall 2018) Eric Cochran, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (DRP, Spring 2018) Chris Chia, The Knot Book by Adams Collins. (DRP, Fall 2017) Canada/USA Mathcamp I am fortunate to have been able to participate in the amazing place that is the Mathcamp for the past four years. Canada/USA Mathcamp is an immersive summer experience for mathematically talented students ages 13‑18 from all over the world. Among other things, I have been designing and teaching some fun courses there and mentoring reading and Lean projects. Following are notes from some of the courses I’ve taught and projects I’ve done with mathcampers. 2020 Lean at MC2020 How to glue donuts How Riemann finally understood logarithms 2019 From High School Arithmetic to Group Cohomology Crash Course on Linear Algebra Riemann Surfaces Galois Correspondence of Covering Spaces 2018 Cohomology via Sheaves The Quantum Spring Would I ever Lie Group to you?

Representation theory Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics All things manifoldy Reading projects: Daniel Koizumi, Riemann Surfaces from Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces by Rick Miranda.

["research.html", "Research Current Projects Past Projects", " Research I work in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. My broad interests are in understanding how homotopy theoretic tools can be used to solve problems from other areas of math. Current Projects 2-groups in Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology I got involved in this project thanks to an MRC Workshop. 2-groups are higher categorical variants of groups. The goal of this project is to find a 2-categorical interpretation of some of naturally occurring objects (Drinfield double of a group) in mathematical physics and extend them using ideas from Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology. 2-groups in HoTT I'm trying to understand how to express and analyze 2-groups in homotopy type theory. Homotopy type theory is a branch of logic that encored homotopy equivalences into one of its fundamental axioms thereby providing a natural formalism for describing homotopy theory. Proof Formalization I am fascinated by the Lean theorem prover. More precisely, by the mathlib community and the work being done toward expanding the existing library. I taught a course about it at Mathcamp 2020. In a group that includes some students from Mathcamp, we are trying to add new mathematical content to the mathlib library. Past Projects An application of the h-principle to Manifold Calculus. This was my PhD thesis, in which I applied homotopy theoretic techniques to study problems for differential geometry. Here is the paper (arXiv version) based on the thesis (Updated on: May 07, 2019). Here are some notes notes1, notes2 from the talks I gave on this topic. Protein folding using Markov chains During my undergrad, I briefly worked on a project involving some protein folding models using basic linear algebra. Information Processing Letters, IPL4801.
