In the Fall of 2020, I'll be teaching Math 2151A (Discrete Math for Engineers). I work in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. My broad interests are in understanding how homotopy theoretic tools can be used to solve problems from other areas of math. While learning homotopy type theory, I came across the Lean theorem prover and have since gotten obsessed with it. I am also very interested in math education. I want to modernize math education and bring it to the 21st century through the use of new technological innovations in teaching and in the process make it more accessible and equitable.

["math-projects.html", "Math Projects Current Past", " Math Projects Current 2-groups in Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology I got involved in this project thanks to an MRC Workshop. 2-groups are higher categorical variants of groups. The goal of this project is to find a 2-categorical interpretation of some of naturally occurring objects (Drinfield double of a group) in mathematical physics and extend them using ideas from Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology. 2-groups in HoTT I'm trying to understand how to express and analyze 2-groups in homotopy type theory. Homotopy type theory is a branch of logic that encored homotopy equivalences into one of its fundamental axioms thereby providing a natural formalism for describing homotopy theory. Proof Formalization I am fascinated by the Lean theorem prover. More precisely, by the mathlib community and the work being done toward expanding the existing library. I taught a course about it at Mathcamp 2020. In a group that includes some students from Mathcamp, we are trying to add new mathematical content to the mathlib library. Past An application of the h-principle to Manifold Calculus. This was my PhD thesis, in which I applied homotopy theoretic techniques to study problems for differential geometry. Here is the paper (arXiv version) based on the thesis (Updated on: May 07, 2019). Here are some notes notes1, notes2 from the talks I gave on this topic. Protein folding using Markov chains During my undergrad, I briefly worked on a project involving some protein folding models using basic linear algebra. Information Processing Letters, IPL4801.

Undergrads are paired with a mentor whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester. It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting. I co-organize the DRP at UWO and in the past have co-organized the DRP at JHU. Following is the list of projects I’ve mentored. Jacob Fabe, Fundamental Group from Topology by Munkres (DRP, Fall 2020) Tim Yau, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (DRP, Fall 2019) Hannah Wool, Topology by Munkres. (DRP, Spring 2019) Sydney Timmerman, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Marián Fecko. (DRP, Fall 2018) Eric Cochran, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (DRP, Spring 2018) Chris Chia, The Knot Book by Adams Collins. (DRP, Fall 2017) Mathcamp I am fortunate to have been able to participate in the amazing place that is the Mathcamp for the past four years. Canada/USA Mathcamp is an immersive summer experience for mathematically talented students ages 13‑18 from all over the world. Among other things, I have been designing and teaching some fun courses there. Following are notes from some of the courses I’ve taught and projects I’ve done with mathcampers. 2020 Lean at MC2020 How to glue donuts How Riemann finally understood logarithms Reading project: Daniel Koizumi, Riemann Surfaces from Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces by Rick Miranda. Lean projects: Kenji, Dedekind Domains in Lean and Michael, Konigsberg Bridge Problem in Lean (code). 2019 Galois Correspondence of Covering Spaces From High School Arithmetic to Group Cohomology Crash Course on Linear Algebra Riemann Surfaces Reading project: Ezra Erives, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Marián Fecko. 2018 How Curved Is a Potato? Cohomology via Sheaves The Quantum Spring Would I ever Lie Group to you? Reading project: Edgar Wang, Algebraic Topology and Alan Yan, Algebraic Topology by Hatcher. 2017 All things manifoldy Euler Characteristic Symmetries of Spaces What is Homology? Representation theory Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics JHU At JHU, I designed and taught a full semester (IBL) Honors Single Variable Calculus course twice and also a couple of shorter intersession courses.

Calculus II for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (UWO, Winter 2020) was a full semester 4 credit course with more than 300 students divided into 2 sections. I was the instructor for one of the sections and was solely responsible for making weekly WebWork homeworks and making exams along with the course coordinator. The class regularly met for 4 hours every week. Calculus I for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (UWO, Fall 2019) was a full semester course with more than 1000 students divided into 10 sections. I was the instructor for one of the sections and was solely responsible for making weekly WebWork homeworks and in-class quizzes. The class regularly met for 4 hours every week. Topics in Category Theory (UWO, Fall 2019) was a full semester reading course for math graduate students that I supervised.
