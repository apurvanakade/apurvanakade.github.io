[["index.html", "Apurva Nakade Apurva Nakade", " Apurva Nakade CV, email: (left as an exercise to the reader) Apurva Nakade   I'm a postdoc at the University of Western Ontario working with Dan Christensen and Chris Kapulkin. My research is in the areas of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. In addition to research, I am very passionate about improving math education. I want to modernize university math education and bring it to the 21st century through the use of new technological innovations in teaching and in the process make it more accessible and equitable. I’m currently teaching Algebraic Topology. "],["projects.html", "Projects Teaching Projects Research Projects", " Projects   Teaching Projects Directed Reading Program The Directed Reading Program is a program for undergrads and grad students/postdocs. Undergrads are paired with a mentor whose interests align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester. It is intended to help motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting. I co-organize the DRP at UWO and in the past have co-organized the DRP at JHU. Following is the list of projects I’ve mentored. Jacob Fabe, Fundamental Group from Topology by Munkres (DRP, Fall 2020) Tim Yau, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (DRP, Fall 2019) Hannah Wool, Topology by Munkres. (DRP, Spring 2019) Sydney Timmerman, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Marián Fecko. (DRP, Fall 2018) Eric Cochran, An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu. (DRP, Spring 2018) Chris Chia, The Knot Book by Adams Collins. (DRP, Fall 2017) Discrete math course - Fall 2020 Most of my time in Fall 2020 was spent designing and teaching an online Discrete Math course. This involved making youtube videos, making and editing WeBWorK problem sets, managing discussion forums, other standard course related chores, and not going insane. I occasionally write about it on my my wordpress blog. Canada/USA Mathcamp Canada/USA Mathcamp is a summer camp for mathematically talented students ages 13‑18 from all over the world. Among other things, I have been designing and teaching some fun courses there. Notes for my courses can be found here. I’ve also supervised the following reading projects: Daniel Koizumi, Riemann Surfaces from Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces by Rick Miranda. Kenji, Dedekind Domains in Lean and Michael, Konigsberg Bridge Problem in Lean (code). Ezra Erives, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists by Marián Fecko. Edgar Wang, Algebraic Topology and Alan Yan, Algebraic Topology by Hatcher. JHU Intersession courses I taught two week-long intersession courses titled Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology and Symmetries &amp; Polynomials. I taught both of these courses in a flipped classroom format. I assigned students guided exercises, which they solved to learn more about the subject. Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology For Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology, I asked the students to read and present applications of algebraic topology to other fields of science of their choosing. We had several exciting conversations about things like applications of knot theory to protein folding and data science. The notes and the student presentations can be found here. Symmetries &amp; Polynomials In the Symmetries &amp; Polynomials course, I taught group theory using permutations of elements and its connection to Galois theory using roots of polynomials. The problem sets for this course can be found here. Honors Single Variable Calculus At JHU, I designed and taught a full semester Honors Single Variable Calculus course for two semesters. This was an experimental full semester four-credit course offered at JHU to first-year undergraduates. The course covered all of the first-year calculus and introduced students to proof writing. This is the first course I had to design from scratch. The materials for this course can be found here. Research Projects I work in the area of algebraic topology and homotopy theory. My broad interests are in understanding how homotopy theoretic tools can be used to solve problems from other areas of math. Proof Formalization I have recently gotten interesting in teaching math to computers using Lean. This is different from doing computations as here we are trying to teach math to computers the same way we understand it. I taught a course about it at Mathcamp 2020. My primary interest in Lean is as a potential tool for teaching math proofs. My secondary interest lies in combining machine learning and theorem proving. These are very long term goals as the field of theorem proving, although rapidly growing, is still very nascent. 2-groups in Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology I got involved in this project thanks to an MRC Workshop. 2-groups are higher categorical variants of groups. The goal of this project is to find a 2-categorical interpretation of some of naturally occurring objects (Drinfield double of a group) in mathematical physics and extend them using ideas from Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology. 2-groups in HoTT I'm trying to understand how to express and analyze 2-groups in homotopy type theory. Homotopy type theory is a branch of logic that encored homotopy equivalences into one of its fundamental axioms thereby providing a natural formalism for describing homotopy theory. An application of the h-principle to Manifold Calculus This was my PhD thesis, in which I applied homotopy theoretic techniques to study problems for differential geometry. Here is the paper (arXiv version) based on the thesis (Updated on: May 07, 2019). Here are some notes notes1, notes2 from the talks I gave on this topic. Protein folding using Markov chains During my undergrad, I briefly worked on a project involving some protein folding models using basic linear algebra. Information Processing Letters, IPL4801.

I believe that my primary responsibility is to teach students how to become good learners. Learning is a skill and like other skills it can be acquired through deliberate practice. Once you become good at learning you can pick up any subject by yourself. However, we do not fully understand how we learn. As such, I try to incorporate a variety of different techniques and methodologies in my classroom. I consider myself a coach and a facilitator and aim at providing a welcoming and supportive environment in my classes, and the rest is up to the students. Learning is also a habit that can only be developed over time. It requires a lot of observation and introspection on the part of both the student and the teacher and is not something that can be rushed. I practice a lot of patience and mindfulness in my teaching. Finally, I teach because it’s fun. I am constantly experimenting with my teaching and learning from my experiences. Every class is unique and presents its own set of goals and challenges. Every class is like a puzzle that I am trying to solve. I love the fact that there is no limit to how much you can improve your teaching.
