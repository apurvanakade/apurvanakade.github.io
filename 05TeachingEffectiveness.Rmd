The data for Discrete Structures for Engineering 2020 is based on
Midterm Check-in as the course is ongoing. There was no end of course
survey for the Winter 2019 semester because of Covid. The complete data,

Teaching Awards
---------------

-   [*William Kelso Morrill Award for Excellence in Mathematics*], JHU
    2019\
    The William Kelso Morrill Award for Excellence in Mathematics is
    given each year to the graduate student in the department of
    mathematics who best displays the traits of Kelso Morrill in his
    teaching - love of teaching, love of mathematics, and concern for
    students.

-   Finalist for the [*KSAS Excellence in Teaching Awards*], JHU 2019\
    Excellence in Teaching Awards honor the best graduate TAs in the
    Krieger School of Arts and Sciences for the care and concern they
    take with their subject and their students. The criterion for
    selection include: engaging students, building community,
    influencing and inspiring students, promoting diversity and culture
    of inclusion, and developing relationships beyond the classroom.

-   [*Prof. Joel Dean award for Excellence in Teaching in
    Mathematics*][*William Kelso Morrill Award for Excellence in Mathematics*],
    JHU 2016\
    Prof. Joel Dean award for Excellence in Teaching in Mathematics is
    an annual award to recognize graduate students and faculty in the
    department of mathematics who have exhibited extraordinary
    performance in teaching undergraduates. The award was initiated by
    Joel and Monia Dean with the objective of promoting excellence in
    undergraduate education at the Krieger School and funded by the Joel
    Dean Foundation created by Professor Dean in 1957.

## Peer Comments

In Winter 2020, I participated in the Teaching Mentor Program at UWO.
  The Teaching Mentor Program is a cohort-based hands-on learning experience. Participants work with a group of 4-5 interdisciplinary graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to observe and offer feedback on one another's teaching. Groups will meet multiple times over the semester to act as students in one another's teaching demonstrations. My group had four participants whose feedback is attached here.
