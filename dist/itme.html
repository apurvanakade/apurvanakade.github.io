<p>I&#39;m a postdoc at the University of Western Ontario working with Dan Christensen and Chris Kapulkin. My research is in the areas of algebraic topology and homotopy theory.</p>
<p>In addition to research, I am very passionate about improving math education. I want to modernize university math education and bring it to the 21st century through the use of new technological innovations in teaching and in the process make it more accessible and equitable.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m currently teaching <a href="https://owl.uwo.ca/portal/site/1fda099f-409e-45c6-ba83-c81bf40a4798">Algebraic Topology</a>.</p>
